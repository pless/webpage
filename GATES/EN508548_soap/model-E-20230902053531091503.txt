Based on the information provided:

1. The treatment seems to be partially consistent with the diagnosis. The prescription of Norvasc (Amlodipine) and Accord (Bendroflumethiazide) indicates the patient is being treated for hypertension, which is consistent with the blood pressure reading of 159/95 mm[Hg]. However, the patient's complaint of headache and general body pain is only addressed by the prescription of Emcap (Paracetamol) for 5 days, which may not be enough if the cause of these symptoms is not addressed.

2. The diagnosis is not explicitly stated, so it's difficult to say if it's consistent with the observations. If the diagnosis is hypertension, it is consistent with the elevated blood pressure reading. However, hypertension alone may not account for the patient's symptoms of headache and general body pain.

3. In a rural health clinic, additional tests that could be helpful include a complete blood count (CBC) to rule out infection or anemia, a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes (which can cause similar symptoms), and a urinalysis to check for signs of kidney disease or urinary tract infection. If possible, an EKG could also be helpful to assess heart health, given the patient's age and high blood pressure.

4. The notable aspect here is that the patient's chief complaints of headache and general body pain are not fully addressed. While paracetamol can help alleviate these symptoms temporarily, the underlying cause of these symptoms needs to be identified and treated. Additionally, the patient's high blood pressure needs to be monitored closely, as it is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
