
The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of uncomplicated malaria. It is important to note that malaria presents differently at different ages, and symptoms of fever in a child might vary depending on age and the underlying cause of fever. However, given that the child had a similar history of fever at the same age a few days prior and the RDT result was positive, the diagnosis of malaria is likely. There are not specific findings in the physical examination that suggests any other etiology of fever. However, if symptoms persist, there should be a reassessment to rule out other possibilities like appendicitis.
It usually does not require extra investigations to establish the diagnosis, but it might be good to assess the nutritional status of the child given the chronic vomiting and weight loss. In case of persistent symptoms, or if the RDT results are consistent with a relapse, it's possible you might need to switch to ACT (Artemisinin-based combination Therapy) which is recommended for treating malaria in children above 6 months. The patient should be counseled to drink enough fluid to prevent dehydration, and it would be good to review with the parents how to administer pain relief medications (Paracetamol 500mg) within the correct dosage for their child's weight.
