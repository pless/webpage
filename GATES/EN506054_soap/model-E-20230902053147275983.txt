Based on the information provided, here are the answers:

1. The treatment is somewhat consistent with the diagnosis. However, a diagnosis was not clearly stated in the review. Buscopan is often used to relieve cramps in the stomach, which can be associated with a variety of conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or menstruation. 

2. It's hard to determine if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations because a specific diagnosis was not provided. The patient's chief complaint is a stomach ache, which could be caused by a variety of conditions. 

3. Depending on the availability in a rural health clinic, further tests that could be helpful include a complete blood count to check for infection or anemia, a pregnancy test (if applicable), a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection, and possibly an ultrasound if appendicitis is suspected.

4. It's notable that the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for four days. Also, there's no mention of other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever, which could help narrow down the diagnosis. The patient's age and gender could also be relevant to the diagnosis, as certain conditions are more common in young women. The treatment plan seems to be lacking a follow-up plan. In a rural setting, it might be appropriate to plan for a phone check-in if the patient can't easily return to the clinic.
