However, there are some concerns because she has had the symptoms for an extended period, and the current treatment might not be enough. If possible, ordering stool tests to confirm gastroenteritis would be a wise move. In the immediate term, the prescribing of antacids might be more beneficial to help the patient feel more comfortable.
Finally, a patient with persistent diarrhea or stomach upset that doesn't respond to basic care should be referred to appropriate specialist care, given the possibility of some gastrointestinal infections that may require further management.
The key is to ensure the patient's hydration, comfort, and support, especially where there are no facilities for further diagnostic testing or specialist referral. An assessment of the general condition of the patient would also be necessary, including monitoring for signs of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis.
