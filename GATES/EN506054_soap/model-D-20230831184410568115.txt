
This appears to be a diagnosis of gastritis, an inflammation of the stomach lining, possibly due to food poisoning. The patient is young and doesn't have any history of abdominal complains. Her temperature is normal, and her other physical signs are also normal. Given the presentation, this diagnosis is reasonable. Other causes of similar symptoms include food poisoning, infection, or cancer of the stomach. However, she is not a higher risk category. Since you are in a rural area with limited resources, the treatment plan can be started and reviewed serially. [Buscopan is a drug that helps reduce abdominal spasm and has anti-inflammatory effects] [There may need to be a follow-up assessment after a few days to ascertain any changes] This interaction seems appropriate.
