
 This patient's abdominal pain suggests peptic ulcer disease. Despite that, these diagnostic tests should likely be delayed. However, given the patient's risk factors given his vomiting history, he should get at least one H. Pylori test, perhaps two, to help establish the diagnosis, if warranted. [Diagnosis: Peptic Ulcer Disease. Risk factor: history of vomiting]. [Contraindications: None]. [Recommended treatments: Ondansetron, Nizatidine, ranitidine, antibiotic therapy (PPIs not recommended when H. Pylori test positive).] This patient was on omeprazole, which is a PPI, but H. Pylori test should guide management. [Ref]: Management of Helicobacter pylori infection [End].
