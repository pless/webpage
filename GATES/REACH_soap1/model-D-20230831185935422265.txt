
This presentation sounds more compatible with irritable bowel than constipation. Consider a diagnosis of IBS-diarrhea given the symptoms, and adjustment of plan accordingly. Please consider doing some stool studies, like faecal calprotectin, to confirm these symptoms. Please note that testing for giardiasis, though available in most clinics, is not necessary in this case since the patient travelled outside of country three months ago. 

Please review the plan and make any necessary adjustments, and see her in follow up to monitor her condition. [/INST] This patient's presentation seems to suggest diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) instead of constipation. Since she presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, and diarrhea, a diagnosis of IBS-D is more suitable. Next steps would be to monitor her symptoms, and adjust the treatment plan as needed. It would be also good to reassess her symptoms and adjustment of the management after follow-up. Moreover, if the patient's symptoms are severe, a referral to a gastroenterologist can be considered.
