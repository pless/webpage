Firstly, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The prescription of Bisacodyl, a stimulant laxative, is appropriate for managing constipation. Encouraging regular water intake is also a common recommendation to help improve bowel movements.

Secondly, the diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the observations. Abdominal pain and decreased appetite can be symptoms of constipation. However, the patient also presents abnormal weight loss and fever, which are not typical symptoms of constipation. 

Thirdly, in a rural health clinic, I would recommend conducting a complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of infection or inflammation that could explain the fever and weight loss. A stool analysis might also be beneficial to rule out bacterial infections or parasites, which could be causing the abdominal pain and weight loss.

Lastly, one notable aspect is the patient's BMI, which is classified as obese. This could potentially contribute to her constipation, but it also puts her at risk for other health issues like heart disease and diabetes. Therefore, a comprehensive plan for weight management might be beneficial.
