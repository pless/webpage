Without a diagnosis and treatment plan, I cannot answer whether the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. However, based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms could suggest a gastrointestinal issue, possibly an infection or food poisoning.

For further testing, in a rural clinic, you might consider a stool sample to check for parasites, bacteria, or other pathogens. A basic blood test could also be useful to check for signs of infection or other abnormalities.

One notable thing is that the patient is experiencing mild dehydration, which is common with diarrhea but needs to be addressed. Ensuring the patient stays hydrated is crucial. Also, the patient's blood pressure is relatively normal, which is a good sign. However, if dehydration worsens, it could lead to hypotension.
