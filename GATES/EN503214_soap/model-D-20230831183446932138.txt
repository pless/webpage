
This patient has signs of dehydration, along with diarrhoea. The recommended treatment is fluid replacement with oral rehydration salts. The patient should be instructed to drink plenty of fluids. Diarrhoea is a common complication of malnutrition. 

This may be seen in food or water infections, particularly in areas where this is more common. The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeing of infants for the first six months. It is important to encourage breastfeeding, as this is more safe than bottled feeding (and formula) and provides a wider array of immune factors. If the mother is in good health, it is recommended to encourage continued breastfeeding even after the child begins solids (cow's milk at six months).

Notes: She should stay hydrated. The mother may also be at risk for dehydration and should also seek medical attention.
