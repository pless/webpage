Based on the information provided, it is hard to answer your questions as there is no specific diagnosis or treatment plan mentioned in the notes. 

Without a clear diagnosis, it's impossible to determine if the treatment is consistent with it. Similarly, we can't say if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations because no diagnosis is given.

As for additional tests, it would depend on the symptoms and diagnosis. In this case, the patient has had a full blood count, kidney function tests, and a lipid profile, all of which are normal. However, without a specific diagnosis, it's hard to say what other tests might be needed. 

The only thing notable is the patient's BMI, which is in the obese range. This could have implications for her health, particularly in terms of cardiovascular risk, and should be addressed in her treatment plan. Also, the doctor's recommendation for the patient to see an eye specialist is also notable but without context, it's hard to understand why this is needed.
