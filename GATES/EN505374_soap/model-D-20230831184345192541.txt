
Consistency: The diagnosis of secondary hypertension is consistent with the patient's history, although her current vital signs are slightly elevated- her blood pressure isn't as elevated as one might expect with secondary hypertension. It's possible that the patient is in a hypertensive crisis. Given the setting, it might be better to consider the patient to be in a hypertensive emergency and refer her to a medical center for immediate evaluation. She should be monitored for symptoms of a hypertensive emergency such as severe headache, neck stiffness, confusion, visual disturbances, palpitations, or chest or abdominal exertional pain. She should be immediately referred to a hospital if she presents any of these symptoms. There are other tests possible in peripheral clinics in rural settings, such as ECG to evaluate for signs of cardiac hypertrophy or to differentiate hypertension from tachycardia caused by other conditions. However, ECG alone is rarely adequate to diagnose secondary hypertension. Given her presentation and the results of the examination so far, the diagnosis would still be primary hypertension in a healthcare setting, with additional testing to rule in other conditions. While waiting for her results, we could start on a baseline trial of a diuretic such as chlorothiazide, with evaluation of her response after about 2 weeks. This could potentially lower her blood pressure and confirm the diagnosis. [The patient's history is consistent with that of secondary hypertension, but given the presentation, a hypertensive emergency should be considered. She should be monitored for symptoms of a hypertensive emergency and be referred if any of these symptoms present.

Consistency: The treatment plan seems reasonable given her primary diagnosis. She should be started on a baseline trial of a diuretic such as chlorothiazide, with evaluation of her response after about 2 weeks. This could potentially lower her blood pressure and confirm the diagnosis. [Given the available resources in a rural health clinic, the initial focus should be on basic laboratory tests like BP measurement]. However, there should be ongoing management of BP for the duration of the illness and beyond. Regular monitoring of BP, both in and outpatient settings, is crucial to controlling the disease. However, since hypertension is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension in this setting, confirmation of her diagnosis with ECG and other testing could be considered. The HPI here suggests secondary hypertension from another cause. However, we need more information to confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, further investigation with laboratory testing is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and suggest adequate management. [The initial plan seems adequate given the available resources in a rural health clinic, but the ongoing management of her hypertension should include regular monitoring of her BP, both in and outpatient settings, to ensure that her disease is adequately controlled]. [The presentation and vital signs suggest a hypertensive emergency, which needs immediate hospitalization. The HPI suggests that this is secondary hypertension from another cause, and investigation should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis and suggest adequate management. Laboratory tests including blood tests and imaging could help rule in differential causes, such as pulmonary embolism].
