First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). 

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's high blood pressure reading of 167/102 mmHg, along with the symptoms of headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision, are indicative of hypertension. 

Third, in a rural setting, other tests that could be performed include a urine analysis to check for kidney problems and a blood test to check for high cholesterol levels, both of which can be related to hypertension. Additionally, a blood glucose test could be performed to check for diabetes, which is another risk factor for hypertension. 

Fourth, it's notable that the patient is relatively young to have hypertension, particularly secondary hypertension, which is usually caused by an underlying condition. It may be worth investigating further to identify any potential underlying conditions. The patient should also be counseled on lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet, reducing salt intake, and quitting smoking or alcohol if applicable.
