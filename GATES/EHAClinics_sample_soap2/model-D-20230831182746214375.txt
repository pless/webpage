
 The plan is logical, but a more systematic approach might be to review for a complication, given her diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease. Other complications of PUD such as erosive gastritis and bleeding might be considered, with appropriate investigations. Her sore Throat likely has secondary cause and not the primary diagnosis. She may benefit from more frequent review and monitoring to follow up on her condition.### Explanation: The diagnosis of acute nasopharyngitis (common cold) is unlikely given the patient's age, season, and symptoms. She does have a known history of peptic ulcer disease, however, and this should be monitored for any deterioration. The patient might also benefit from ongoing management, given her known history of peptic ulcer disease and recurrent episodes. A review of the patient's diet including food intake and dietary habits might be useful. A review of the patient's lifestyle to reduce the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms might also be helpful.
