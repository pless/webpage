First, the treatment seems consistent with the diagnosis. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker often used to treat high blood pressure, which aligns with the diagnosis of essential hypertension.

Second, the diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the observations. The patient's high blood pressure (164/87 mm[Hg]) could indicate hypertension. However, the symptoms of headache and dizziness are quite common and could be due to many other conditions as well. 

Third, other tests that might be helpful and available in a rural health clinic could include blood tests to check for anemia or kidney function, which could cause dizziness. A more detailed neurological examination might also be beneficial to rule out other causes for the headache and dizziness. 

Fourth, it is notable that the patient is acutely ill appearing and in mild distress. Also, the patient is at risk of falls due to her dizziness, which is a concern in this age group. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms have been present for only 2 days, which might suggest an acute rather than a chronic condition. It's also worth noting that the patient's pain is relatively mild (4 on a scale of 1 to 10), which might not be expected if the headache and dizziness were solely due to high blood pressure. Therefore, further investigation into the cause of these symptoms might be warranted.
