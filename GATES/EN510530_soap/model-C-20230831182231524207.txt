Amlodipine belongs to the class of calcium channel blockers, which reduce blood pressure by decreasing the influx of calcium into smooth muscle cells in the arterial walls. So given this patient presentation, this is an appropriate treatment. [1] [2] [3]. In this rural health setting, the laboratory tests for managing Primary Hypertension can include regular monitoring of blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and urinalysis to detect associated conditions like Diabetes, or renal disease. Depending on the patient's condition and lifestyle, other interventions such as dietary counseling, physical exercise, psychological support, health education, quit smoking, and avoid high-sodium, high-fat diets can also be considered. Also, considering the patient's dizziness, it may be worth recommending further testing, which could include an electrocardiogram(ECG) or a cardiac echography, to assess for structural heart disease like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease. [4] [5]. 

The patient's risk assessment for Fall is a key concern in this case, given the patient's age, presenting symptoms, and systemic factors. So, fall assessment tools like Timed Up-and-Go test could be recommended. Moulding, a rehabilitation specialist, identifies four important factors for falls prevention: a good environment, good home safety assessment, adequate exercise, and adequate social support. Also, other interventions such as physical activity, cognitive training, and managing medication regiments could be included. [6]. [7]. [8]. [9]. [10].

In rural health settings, the availability of investigative tests is always a challenge, and the focus is often on managing the known conditions. However, It is important to continue monitoring the blood pressure and assessing the patient's condition over time to consider further tests or interventions. [11]. [12]. [13].
