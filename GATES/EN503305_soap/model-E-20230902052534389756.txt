Based on the information provided, it is not possible to answer your questions as key information is missing. There is no diagnosis or treatment plan provided, and the differential diagnosis is also blank. Additionally, while the patient reports abdominal pain, there are no other specific observations or examination findings recorded that would help to identify the potential cause or suggest further tests. 

However, based on the complaint of abdominal pain, in a rural health clinic, you might want to consider tests such as a urine pregnancy test (if the patient is sexually active and there's a chance she could be pregnant), urinalysis (to rule out a urinary tract infection), and basic blood tests (to check for signs of infection or anemia). If possible, an abdominal ultrasound could also be beneficial to look for causes like gallstones or appendicitis, but availability might be an issue in a rural setting.

Beyond this, it is crucial to make a more detailed assessment, including the exact location of the pain, its nature (sharp, dull, cramping, etc.), any associated symptoms (fever, vomiting, diarrhea, changes in appetite or weight), and any relevant medical or surgical history. This will help to guide the diagnosis and treatment plan.
