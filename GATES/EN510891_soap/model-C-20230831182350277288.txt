
The treatment plan seems appropriate for diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The RDT was already done, and the result was positive. EmCap (Paracetamol 500mg) is a good choice to provide symptomatic relief in this case. However, in rural areas, there might be a shortage of diagnostic tools and resources. Therefore, there might be need to rely on simpler diagnostic tests and procedures like detecting for fever or blood in urine, but these are less reliable. There is no other notable aspect about this case.
