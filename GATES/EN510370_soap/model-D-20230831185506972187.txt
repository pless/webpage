It is an important factor that can contribute to her health status, as well as confirm whether her BP is well controlled as she mentioned since being diagnosed a week ago. However, confirming BP at home can be challenging due to the difficulties in regular access to equipment for measuring BP. In this situation, home BP measurements at regular intervals and a change in lifestyle to increase physical activity and maintain good nutrition and weight management are advised.

Notable findings in the case include a history of known hypertension, and normal BP readings by a health worker. However, this may not be the accurate case, as hypertension can remain uncontrolled for a long time without significant signs. A thorough physical examination at her next appointment may be necessary.

The patient's anthropometry readings are good, indicating she is a good candidate for home BP monitoring.

This case requires further discussion with the patient to manage her blood pressure and other related conditions. A review of her BP and any lifestyle changes should be done regularly.
