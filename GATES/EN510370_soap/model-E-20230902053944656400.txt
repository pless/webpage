1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker often used in the management of essential hypertension.

2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's blood pressure reading of 146/101 mm[Hg] is indicative of hypertension.

3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
Yes, routine blood tests including a complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and kidney function tests could be useful to monitor any possible side effects of Amlodipine and to assess overall health. Additionally, a urine test could be conducted to check for protein or other signs of kidney damage, which can be associated with hypertension. If available, an EKG could be useful to assess the patient's heart health.

4. Is there anything else notable?
It is notable that the patient's BMI is within the normal range, which is good as obesity can contribute to hypertension. However, the patient's blood pressure is still high, indicating that the hypertension may be due to other factors, potentially genetic. It is also important to ensure the patient understands the importance of medication adherence, lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and limiting alcohol and tobacco use.
