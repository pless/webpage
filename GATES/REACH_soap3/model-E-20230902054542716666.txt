Based on the information provided, I am unable to answer your questions as the notes are incomplete. Here are the missing pieces of information:

1. Diagnosis: There is no information on the diagnosis made for the patient.
2. Observations: There are no observations or physical examination results mentioned, hence it's impossible to determine if the diagnosis is consistent.
3. Tests: Without a diagnosis, it's hard to suggest what additional tests should be carried out.
4. Treatment: There is no treatment plan provided.
5. Notable things: The patient's history of presenting illness is very brief with no specifics about the body pain. Information about the patient's medical history, family history, and current medications would be useful in making a diagnosis. The patient's vital signs and anthropometry results are also missing.
