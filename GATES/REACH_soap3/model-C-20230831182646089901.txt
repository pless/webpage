
 This patient's presentation suggests rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, or a malignancy. To confirm a diagnosis, several tests may be useful. These tests include serological tests in blood like erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and blood counts with white blood cell count. However, since you are in rural areas, it might be challenging to conduct these tests. Therefore, you should consider an alternative diagnosis of rheumatic fever, which could be confirmed by tests such as anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and antinuclear antibody (ANA). If this confirms the diagnosis, it will be helpful if you look for specific treatment guidelines.
