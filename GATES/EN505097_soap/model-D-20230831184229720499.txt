She denies fever or recent travel. The diagnosis could be migraine but could also be tension headache or another secondary headache due to her history of dialysis. The next step would be to discuss these possibilities with her, depending on what she prefers. Testing for migraine may include checking her thyroid function or checking for any gastrointestinal issues that can be aggravated by these medications. Given her remote location, it would be acceptable to prescribe a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug over the phone or electronically, depending on her preference and local regulations. If you were to suspect another secondary headache, you should consider referral for further investigation.
