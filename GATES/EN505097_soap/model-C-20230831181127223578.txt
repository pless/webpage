
This patient presents with a history of 7 days of severe headache, along with dizziness and insomnia, which could suggest migraine. She also reports a fall risk, which is a specific concern given her history of falls. Even though she is being discharged, we would recommend that she continue managing her chronic migraine with her current medications. At her next appointment, we would assess her condition and consider any further interventions. [Type the author’s name] [Type the name of the report] [Date of the report]. [Source of the report]. [Anything else notable in this case]. [Are there any additional tests that you suggest?]. [Is everything else okay?].  [Send a copy of the report if you wish]. [Review with the patient]. [Ask her to self-monitor her condition]. [Please get back to me], [Your contact information].  (Author's Comment: This patient is likely suffering from Migraine, given the duration of the headaches. The history of falls suggests that there may be gaps in her current management, including potential management of medication overuse. Further investigations may be required, but this initial consultation seems to suggest more a question of management than anything else). [Please review with patient and see if additional steps are warranted]. [Provide copy of report if wished]. [Review Fall Risk Assessment]. [Ask for patient's feedback]. [Ask about any further concerns]. (Subjective: The patient presents with a long history of headaches, and although she doesn't identify any specific triggers, there is a potential for both physical and psychological factors to be contributing. It is also possible that her symptoms could be related to her anxiety. The patient is aware of the general principles of the condition, though she may benefit from additional education on managing this, in particular, given its impact on her daily life (insomnia and dizziness) [Objective: Consistent with migraine. The fall risk assessment suggests the potential for a higher risk of falls due to her condition [Assessment: On the face of it, it suggests Migraine. However, further investigation, such as blood tests, would be useful, given her history of falls) [Plan: The patient should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation as the initial primary care management is likely suboptimal; we also would consider managing the anxiety to help her cope with the migraines. She should be educated on this too (the need for further investigation and treatment) [Follow-up: Review at a regular appointment (2-week interval initially) to assess progress and to look at whether any issues need to be addressed [Additional Suggestions: Please arrange for further investigations. This patient should be considered for the migraine treatment trials if she has significant impact on her daily life and quality of life. She should also be considered for further psychological support for her anxiety. Further, a risk assessment should be conducted to identify potential safety concerns, such as the falls] This report provides information to the patient and the next primary care provider (PCP) about the treatment. An ongoing care plan and regular follow-up would be advisable) [Review with the patient: The plan, and the need for this to be followed-up].
