  Certainly, I'd be happy to help you review the interaction you had with the patient. Based on the information provided, here are my answers to your questions:
1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment plan of prescribing amlodipine 10mg once daily for 14 days is consistent with the diagnosis of hypertension secondary to endocrine disorders. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that helps to relax blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and manage hypertension. The duration of treatment (14 days) is also appropriate for a patient with recent-onset hypertension.
2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the diagnosis of hypertension secondary to endocrine disorders is consistent with the patient's history of dizziness and headache over the past 2 days. Hypertension can be a common symptom of endocrine disorders such as hyperthyroidism or hypoparathyroidism, which can cause changes in blood pressure.
3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
Yes, in a rural health clinic setting, some additional tests that might be useful to consider include:
* Electrolyte panel: Hypertension can be associated with electrolyte imbalances, and an electrolyte panel can help identify any abnormalities in sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels.
* Lipid profile: Hypertension is often associated with dyslipidemia, and a lipid profile can help identify any abnormalities in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
* Renal function tests: Hypertension can be associated with kidney damage, and renal function tests can help identify any abnormalities in kidney function.
* Thyroid function tests: As mentioned earlier, hypertension can be associated with endocrine disorders such as hyperthyroidism or hypoparathyroidism, and thyroid function tests can help identify any abnormalities in thyroid hormone levels.
4. Is there anything else notable?
Yes, it's worth noting that the patient's blood pressure reading of 173/91 mmHg is quite elevated, and this may indicate that the patient has severe hypertension. It would be important to monitor the patient's blood pressure regularly and adjust the treatment plan as needed to control the hypertension. Additionally, it's important to consider the patient's other medical history and any other symptoms she may be experiencing to rule out any other underlying conditions that may be contributing to her hypertension.
