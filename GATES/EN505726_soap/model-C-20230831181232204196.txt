What this shows is that the treatment plan of beta-blocker with an ACEi or an ARB would be more appropriate rather than Amlodipine alone. You should test for secondary causes of hypertension, like renal artery stenosis, Cushing's syndrome, and so on. Given her presentation and symptoms and her age, a high index of suspicion for secondary causes makes sense to investigate further. This is more likely a job for an internist.
However, in a rural area where referral might be more difficult, primary care providers must be able to make diagnoses, decide on appropriate treatment, and be prepared to deal with complications. In this case, treatment with Amlodipine and LAB tests would be appropriate.
