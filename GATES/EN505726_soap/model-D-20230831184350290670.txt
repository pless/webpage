However, I would have considered some additional questions to gather further information, especially about the patient's medical history. For instance, what are her medical problems, and could they have contributed to her symptoms? Might her dizziness be related to a balance disorder? Could her primary cause be due to a secondary cause from her medical condition? However, this information is unlikely to change the management plan.
