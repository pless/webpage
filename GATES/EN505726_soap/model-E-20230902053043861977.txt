First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Amlodipine, which is a calcium channel blocker, is commonly used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It works by relaxing the muscles of your heart and blood vessels.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's high blood pressure (173/91 mmHg) is a clear sign of hypertension. The symptoms of dizziness and headache can also be associated with hypertension, although they could be caused by a variety of other conditions as well.

Third, other tests that might be beneficial and available in a rural health clinic could include a urine test to check for kidney problems (which can cause hypertension), blood tests to check for high cholesterol and diabetes (which are often associated with hypertension), and an EKG to check for heart disease. It might also be helpful to have the patient monitor her blood pressure at home, if possible.

Fourth, it's notable that the patient's hypertension is listed as "secondary to endocrine disorders." This suggests that the patient has an underlying endocrine disorder that is causing her hypertension. Therefore, it would be important to manage this underlying condition in addition to treating the hypertension. If this is not possible in a rural setting, the patient may need referral to a specialist.
