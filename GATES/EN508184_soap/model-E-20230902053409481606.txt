First, the treatment plan of using Antallerg eye drops is not consistent with a clear diagnosis as there is no specific diagnosis provided. Antiallergic eye drops might be useful if the patient was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis or another allergy-related eye condition, but this is not stated in the notes.

Second, the diagnosis is not consistent with the observations. The patient presents with blurry vision in the right eye and an itchy left eye. These symptoms could indicate various conditions such as refractive errors, dry eye, allergies, or more serious conditions like glaucoma or retinal disorders. However, a specific diagnosis has not been made, making it impossible to determine if it aligns with the symptoms.

Third, additional tests available in rural health clinics that could be considered include a visual acuity test to assess the extent of the blurry vision, a cover test to check for strabismus, a color vision test, and a slit-lamp examination to examine the structures of the eye in detail. An intraocular pressure (IOP) test could also be helpful to rule out glaucoma. 

Fourth, it's notable that the patient's blood pressure reading is incomplete (100/0 mm[Hg]). This could be a typographical error, but it's important to have accurate blood pressure readings for overall health assessments. It's also worth noting that the notes lack a detailed history of the patient's present illness and any differential diagnosis, which are important for a comprehensive assessment.
