
 The diagnosis of conjunctivitis is consistent with the presenting complaint of blurry vision and itchiness on the eye for the last 14 days. The treatment plan of antallergic eye drops 4 times daily for one month is appropriate, provided that the patient also uses preservative-free eye drops because of the risk of bacterial keratitis associated with conjunctivitis. Other tests may not be feasible in a rural health clinic. The patient should be advised to continue their treatment plan strictly and to report back if the symptoms worsen or if they have new symptoms like fever or vision changes.
