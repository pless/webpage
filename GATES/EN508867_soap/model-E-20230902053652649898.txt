Based on the information provided, I cannot answer the four questions as neither a diagnosis nor treatment plan was provided. The patient's symptoms of heartburn and chest discomfort could suggest a number of conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, or even cardiac issues. 

In a rural health clinic setting, some tests that could be helpful might include an EKG to rule out heart conditions, a complete blood count to check for anemia which might suggest bleeding ulcers, and perhaps a test for Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria that can cause ulcers. 

However, without more information on the diagnosis and treatment plan, I cannot offer a complete analysis.
