
The patient's symptoms and RDT result both indicate that she has allergic rhinitis, though further investigation to determine whether her symptoms are primary, intercurrent, or associated with sinusitis and other conditions might be warranted depending on the presence of other complaints or circumstances. Given her location and healthcare setting, an antibiotic may not be necessary, and antihistamines such as fexofenadine may be adequate treatment. The use of decongestants for symptoms of catarrh may also be appropriate. Another option would be to review the patient's chronic diseases, allergies, and medications (including OTC medicine) to confirm that it is not related to one of these.  

The diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms described, but given the rural setting, it would be valuable to have further investigations to rule out other conditions.
There is nothing else notable in the presentation.
 The HPI should include information about the duration and frequency of her symptoms. More investigation is needed to make a diagnosis.
