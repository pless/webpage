1. The treatment is not consistent with the diagnosis. The patient has been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis, but there is no mention of any treatment plan for this condition like antihistamines or nasal corticosteroids. 

2. The diagnosis is partially consistent with the observations. Allergic rhinitis can indeed cause symptoms such as catarrh (nasal congestion), headache, and coughing. However, fever is not a common symptom of allergic rhinitis and may suggest an infection.

3. Additional tests that could be conducted in a rural health clinic may include:
   - A complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of infection which could explain the fever.
   - A throat swab to test for strep throat or other bacterial infections.
   - A chest x-ray if available, to rule out pneumonia or other respiratory conditions, especially if the cough is severe or persistent.

4. It is notable that the patient's pain rating is quite high (5), concentrated in the head, which along with the fever could suggest a more serious condition such as a sinus infection, meningitis, or another type of infection. It would be important to monitor these symptoms closely and refer for further evaluation if they persist or worsen. Also, the negative Malaria RDT is a good sign but does not completely rule out other causes of fever.
