
This patient's presentation is suggestive of allergic rhinitis. While a malaria test was performed, given the negative result, there doesn't appear to be a reason to continue with further testing. What was done here appears to be evidence-based and appropriate. There are no other immediate issues that come to mind. Given the rural setting, one potential concern would be access to antibiotics, as it must be ensured that any antibiotic prescriptions are appropriate for that setting. One potential complication would be if the individual does not adhere to the advised treatment, and the diagnosis is not adequately managed. It would be reasonable to do follow-ups to ensure the patient is doing well.
