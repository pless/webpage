First, the treatment seems to be consistent with the diagnosis. The patient has been diagnosed with Tinea corporis, a type of fungal infection that affects the skin, and the treatment includes Erythromycin, which is an antibiotic that can treat or prevent certain bacterial infections, Hydrocortisone cream, which can help to alleviate skin inflammation and itching, and Chlorpheniramine, an antihistamine used to relieve allergic symptoms such as rash, itching, and runny nose. 

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient presents with a skin rash, which is a common symptom of Tinea corporis.

Third, other tests that could be done in a rural setting might include a skin scraping for microscopic examination or a fungal culture to confirm the diagnosis of Tinea corporis. 

Fourth, one thing to note is that Erythromycin is an antibiotic and Tinea corporis is a fungal infection. While Erythromycin can be used to prevent secondary bacterial infections, it may not be effective against the fungus causing the rash. An antifungal medication could be more appropriate. Also, it's important to ensure the patient or his caregivers understand how to apply the Hydrocortisone cream correctly, as overuse can potentially lead to skin thinning.
