
The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis is otherwise wide, but the symptoms suggest malaria as the likely cause. If the fever persists, a repeat RDT should be done. Vitamin supplementation is always recommended. The pain management plan may consider non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like paracetamol. However, while it may reduce the fever, it's not the first-line treatment for malaria. The patient should be educated on how to avoid mosquito bites and the signs of malaria recurrence. [1B, Level 3] [1C] [2] [3] [4]
### Recommendation: 
There is nothing else to note here. The investigation and treatment plan seem appropriate. The patient needs education on malaria prevention.
