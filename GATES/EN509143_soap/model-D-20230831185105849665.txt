The positive RDT confirmed the diagnosis. However, these are the tests that can be done in a rural health clinic when malaria is highly suspected based on the presence of fever and other symptoms. More sophisticated tests like rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) should be used to confirm the diagnosis, but their accessibility might be limited in some areas. It is crucial to consider the differential diagnosis, including typhoid fever, other viral or bacterial infections, and other systemic infections. Initial management, which includes managing symptoms, confirming the diagnosis with further investigations, and starting appropriate treatment with antimalarial drugs, should be guided by the health facility's malaria guidelines. [A case would be managed and discharged if the RDT result was positive (positive confirmatory test results) in a rural health clinic.
