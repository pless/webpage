
 The diagnosis of malaria is based on the presence of symptoms and laboratory evidence, such as a positive RDT (rapid diagnostic test). Further investigations may not be necessary, or rather be required if the parasitological diagnosis has been challenged. Treatment is based on clinical presentation, and in this case, it is appropriate to use artemether-lumefantrine (Shalartem) for uncomplicated felmale malaria since it is effective and well tolerated. There should be consideration for future anti-malarial treatment to prevent relapse and for the management of fever during pregnancy.

### Action: The RDT result is positive, so the first line anti-malarial therapy should be initiated promptly. Further management should be based on the patient's clinical presentation. If her fever persists after treatment, then the other indications for management would be considered. The patient's plan should be reviewed to ensure that she has received the full treatment course and re-examined for any signs of treatment failure and management should be done accordingly. Follow-up should be arranged after the therapy.
