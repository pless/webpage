Given the patient's history of insomnia and his recent history of headache and fever, it appears that a potential diagnosis of tension headache, rather than a severe headache disorder, is the most appropriate. There are few testing options that are readily available in a rural health clinic, such as complete blood count or inflammatory markers. The patient was tested for malaria, which is a common condition in those areas. For patients with suspected insomnia, it is important to assess for potential associated conditions. It would be good to investigate further, like conducting a sleep diary to assess duration and quality of sleep, assess daytime function, and check for medication side effects. It would also be useful to assess for medical, psychological, or social factors that may be causing sleep disturbance. There is a lot to consider, and the case presents complexities that suggest a more thorough investigation.
