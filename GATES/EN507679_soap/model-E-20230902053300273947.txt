Based on the information provided:

1. It's hard to say if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis because no specific treatment plan or diagnosis is provided in your notes.

2. It's difficult to say if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations because no diagnosis has been given in your notes.

3. Based on the symptoms (insomnia, headache, fever), additional tests that could be conducted in a rural clinic might include a complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of infection, a rapid strep test if there's a sore throat, a urine test to rule out urinary tract infections, and a chest X-ray if there's a cough or other respiratory symptoms. The high blood pressure might also suggest a need for ongoing monitoring or lifestyle counseling. The patient's reported upper back pain might also warrant a physical examination, if possible.

4. It's notable that the patient's blood pressure is quite high (140/100 mmHg), which could potentially indicate hypertension. This would need to be confirmed with repeated measurements over time. The patient's age is also listed as 123 years, which is exceptionally old - it's unclear if this is accurate or perhaps a typographical error.
