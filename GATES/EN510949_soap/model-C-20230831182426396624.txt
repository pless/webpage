
In this case, the patient's treatment plan with suspended cough syrup and over-the-counter syrup is appropriate for their symptomatic relief. However, you should not give these prescriptions on the same day. Suspend the cough syrup until the next seven days, and after seven days start the cough syrup twice daily for the subsequent five days. 
The girl's history and physical examination suggest allergies to both cold and common cold. You should not give paracetamol without consulting her Paediatrician, and you should not give her any antibiotic except on the instructions of a Paediatrician. While the patient doesn't have HbSS, it is important to conduct a HbSS screening test since it's a susceptible type of Haemophilia and the patient is immunocompetent, which makes her eligible for screening. To avoid being inappropriate for this condition, you should reassess this girl's complaints regularly. You should also give her the full schedule of immunizations according to schedule. You should review the patient's management in about five days to assess her symptoms and review her physical examination, and you can consider the use of cough syrup at that time.
