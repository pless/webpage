
 This interaction with the patient seems to be a straightforward case of a skin rash, likely due to an allergic reaction from an insect bite. The treatment plan, with symptomatic measures of cool compresses and anti-inflammatory corticosteroid cream, makes sense for this diagnosis. However, you may consider asking about other potential causes for the rash, as these can be difficult to diagnose solely based on the rash alone. Since the patient was not forthcoming about the cause of the rash, further conversation skills should be deployed to help elicit more information. For example, you could reassure the patient that the rash may be due to an insect bite, despite the patient's claims of not having any. This approach would encourage the patient to provide more information about their history and potential exposures.
