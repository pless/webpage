
 This could potentially be a case of gum abscess, which is usually accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and chills, along with difficulty opening the mouth, pain, and swelling. However, the lack of systemic signs and the history of itching without pain might suggest a condition like "Gingivostomatitis". It's crucial to perform diagnostic tests, like blood cultures for this differential diagnosis or other local tests. Given the patient is in rural area, blood test for local infectious diseases might be difficult to perform in rural areas. Pain management is necessary to keep the patient comfortable. Antibiotics for secondary infections in case of abscess should be avoided. The patient should be referred to a dentist for further evaluation and management.

A local oral examination might also be useful, as there could be other common oral conditions like dental caries, toothache, or tonsillitis. Other tests that could be considered are a comprehensive oral examination, blood cultures, and imaging tests to rule out other conditions affecting the mouth if the differential diagnosis of Abscess isn't confirmed.
While this condition is not life-threatening, the possibility of systemic complications must be considered, and prompt referral to a medical officer or a dentist for further management is necessary. Patients who are uncomfortable, have systemic signs, or are not improving should be re-evaluated and potentially transferred to a more advanced healthcare setting. 

If the diagnosis is confirmed, management requires pain relief management, and the abscess should be treated with appropriate antibiotics, with surgical drainage if possible. Follow-up is necessary for wound healing until the wound is fully healed (which usually takes a week or two).

It is possible to manage a case like this in a rural area with a community healthcare worker with guidance from a medical or dental officer.
