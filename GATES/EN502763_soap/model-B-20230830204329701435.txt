  Certainly, I'd be happy to help you review the interaction you had with the patient. Based on the information provided, here are my answers to your questions:
1. Consistency of treatment with diagnosis: Yes, the treatment plan (i.e., prescription for contraceptives) is consistent with the diagnosis of family planning.
2. Consistency of diagnosis with observations: Yes, the diagnosis of family planning is consistent with the patient's chief complaint and history of presenting illness (HPI).
3. Other tests that might be available in rural health clinics: Since the patient has been sexually active and desires to prevent pregnancy, it would be appropriate to test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. However, these tests may not be available in all rural health clinics, depending on the resources and infrastructure available.
4. Anything else notable: The patient's blood pressure of 123/81 mmHg is elevated, which may be a sign of hypertension or preeclampsia, particularly in pregnant women. It would be important to monitor the patient's blood pressure regularly and consider referral to a specialist if the elevation persists or worsens.
In summary, the treatment plan and diagnosis seem appropriate based on the information provided. However, it is important to consider the patient's sexual history and potential for STIs, and to monitor the patient's blood pressure regularly to rule out any underlying conditions that may require further management.
