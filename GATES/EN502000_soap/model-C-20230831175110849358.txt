
The intervention seems reasonable, given the diagnosis of fever. However, it's vital to have a complete blood count to rule out any other conditions that could be causing fever, such as typhoid fever, infection, or other infections. It would also be appropriate to have blood films to assess further. It's important to look for other causes of fever in rural areas, especially if there are no other medical facilities nearby.

The fever might be managed with antipyretics. However, you should keep a close out for signs of complications, such as sepsis, in severe cases. In general, treatment should be commenced with a full blood count examination. 

Notes on the case: This patient could have a severe disease, such as typhoid fever. However, the patient's age, with other symptoms not present, could indicate childhood malaria or another infection. This case highlights the need for a full blood count and other blood tests, particularly in rural areas to exclude other causes of fever.
