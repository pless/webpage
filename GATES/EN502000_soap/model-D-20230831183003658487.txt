Given the rural setting, other available tests, might be blood smear to rule out malaria. Other possible test may include blood count to check for anemia, blood culture to rule out sepsis, and chest x-ray to identify any other respiratory infections. It is worth noting this patient could have a viral infection, which could mean that the treatment is appropriate for fever but might not address the underlying cause. [1] [2]. [3]. [4]. [5].
