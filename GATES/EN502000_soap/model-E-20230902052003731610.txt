1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Paracetamol is a common medication used to reduce fever.

2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's chief complaint is fever, which matches the diagnosis of "Fever, unspecified."

3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
Yes. In a rural health clinic, it might be beneficial to assess the source of the fever by testing for common infections such as malaria, dengue, or typhoid, especially if these diseases are prevalent in the area. A complete blood count (CBC) could also be helpful to identify any signs of infection or inflammation. 

4. Is there anything else notable?
One thing that stands out is that the patient's blood pressure was not recorded. It's also notable that the patient is less than a year old. Infants can be more susceptible to serious infections and diseases, so it's important to monitor them closely and consider a broad range of potential causes when they present with a fever. Furthermore, the dosage of paracetamol should be carefully considered given the age of the patient.
