Malaria and other bacterial causes of fever could also be considered, but the vital signs suggest a viral infection. The patient urgently requires oral rehydration therapy to prevent further dehydration. This assessment is consistent with the observations provided, but this patient needs more laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. The available tests may not be adequate to diagnose typhoid or cholera, but may help to rule them out. It's not advisable to perform invasive tests without adequate training and resources. Other issues to look out for would be dehydration, which should be treated promptly, and other complications like diarrhea and bacteremia, which should be monitored. If malaria testing is performed, results could be used to determine the appropriate antimalarial. Another notable feature could be the patient's age, which raises considerations for the risk of serious complications. This requires the counsel and support of the patient's caregivers. [1,2]
