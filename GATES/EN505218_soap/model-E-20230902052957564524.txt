As an AI, I'm unable to review an interaction without complete information provided. In this case, the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment plan are not provided in your notes. Also, the patient's symptoms are quite general (cattarh, cough, headache) and could be indicative of a variety of conditions from a common cold to sinusitis.

If you could provide more information about the patient's symptoms, the diagnosis made, and the treatment plan, I would be better able to assist in reviewing the interaction. Furthermore, any relevant tests carried out such as temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, or any lab tests (like complete blood count, or rapid antigen test for influenza or COVID-19 if available) could also be helpful. 

Without these details, it's difficult to answer your four questions accurately. However, from the information given, it might be worth considering tests for common respiratory illnesses if they are available in your rural clinic. This could include a Strep test, influenza test, or even a COVID-19 test depending on the resources available.
