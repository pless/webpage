
The treatment plan is not suitable for the chief complaint of fever and catarrh. Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine while Paracetamol is a pain relief medication. It is unlikely that chlorpheniramine will help the patient's symptoms. If the clinical presentation is due to allergies, it is more likely to be conjunctivitis or sneezing due to the presence of catarrh, not fever. These complaints should be managed separately.

Testing for concurrent infections could be done if there was concern based on the patient's history, such as an elevated temperature, confusion, or an inability to take fluids. In a rural area, tests for infection, such as a blood culture, would be appropriate. Tuberculosis cannot be ruled out in the absence of a chest X-ray, which is typically recommended in this setting. A detailed history of her symptoms could be more useful than an initial diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. If conjunctivitis or sneezing is the likely diagnosis, specific treatment would be appropriate.
