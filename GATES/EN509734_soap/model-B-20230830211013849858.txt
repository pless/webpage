  Based on the information provided, here are my answers to your 4 questions:
1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment plan for the patient is consistent with the diagnosis of chest pain and possible musculoskeletal injury. The patient was advised to take diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which is commonly used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation in musculoskeletal conditions.
2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the diagnosis of chest pain and possible musculoskeletal injury is consistent with the patient's history of presenting illness (HPI) and physical examination findings. The patient reported sudden onset of pain on the right side of the chest after sleeping on a hard surface, which is consistent with the diagnosis of musculoskeletal injury. The absence of cough, breathlessness, and other symptoms such as epigastric pain, vomiting, and loose stool also supports the diagnosis.
3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
Yes, there are other tests that could be conducted in a rural health clinic to further evaluate the patient's condition. These might include:
* Chest X-ray: This can help rule out other possible causes of chest pain, such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
* Electrocardiogram (ECG): This can help evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out any cardiac causes of chest pain.
* Complete Blood Count (CBC): This can help evaluate the patient's overall health status and rule out any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions.
* Urinalysis: This can help evaluate the patient's kidney function and rule out any underlying kidney problems.
4. Is there anything else notable?
Yes, there are a few other things that are notable about this patient's presentation:
* The patient's history of smoking is a concern, as smoking is a known risk factor for a number of health problems, including cardiovascular disease and various types of cancer. The patient should be advised to quit smoking and provided with resources to help them do so.
* The patient's BMI is slightly elevated, which is also a concern for their overall health. The patient should be advised to maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.
* The patient's pain is rated as 5/10, which suggests that it is moderate in severity. The patient should be advised to take their medication as directed and to seek further medical attention if their pain does not improve.
