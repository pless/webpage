
The treatment seems unexceptionable for a diagnosis of senile cataract. It is important that the patient understand that this is a chronic condition, and management is largely surgical. A referral for surgery was reasonable. Of course, other conditions like primary cataract or uveitis need to be considered and ruled out to begin cataract surgery. This diagnosis is appropriate based on the patient's history and presentation.  Please be careful not jump to assumptions based on a limited presentation. A careful case taking and examination is needed to confirm the DDx. The local healthcare provider might be able to offer diagnostic tests like slit lamp biomicroscopy or ophthalmoscopy, depending on the specifics of the presentation and the equipment available in the rural area.
