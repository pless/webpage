
This case warrants cataract surgery based on the patient's report of blurry vision for over three months and failure of LE Cataract surgery performed two years ago in ECWA. This diagnosis is consistent with what we would expect based on patient's symptoms and medical history. While it may seem counterintuitive, LE Cataract surgery is often indicated for patient's with previous LE Cataract surgery and current cataract symptoms. The case seems straightforward from a clinical perspective, and there are typically no other laboratory tests needed in most cases. However, you could consider blood pressure checks to check for hypertension or diabetes.

Is there anything else that you want to discuss or is there any other concern?
