First, the treatment of referring the patient for surgery is consistent with the diagnosis of senile cataract. Surgery is the primary treatment for this condition.

Second, the diagnosis of senile cataract is consistent with the patient's presentation of difficulties in seeing for over three months, especially given the patient's age and prior history of cataract surgery. 

Third, there are other tests that could be performed to confirm the diagnosis and ensure there are no other underlying conditions contributing to the patient's symptoms. An eye exam, including a slit-lamp examination and visual acuity test, could provide more information about the state of the patient's eyes. Additionally, given the patient's elevated blood pressure, it would be advisable to conduct regular blood pressure monitoring and possibly a blood test to rule out other systemic conditions like diabetes, which can affect vision and are common in rural areas.

Fourth, the patient's low body weight (35 kg) and low BMI (12.9 kg/m^2) is notable. This could be indicative of malnutrition or another underlying condition that might need to be addressed. It's also notable that the patient's blood pressure is quite high (180/90 mmHg), which could indicate untreated hypertension. Both of these issues should be addressed along with the patient's vision problems.
