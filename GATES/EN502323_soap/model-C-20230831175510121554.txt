
 This patient is seeking family planning management, which is recommended for people who do not want to conceive. A contraceptive injection would be a suitable option based on the patient's desire. It is important to ensure that consent was obtained adequately, and the patient was fully educated on the effects, dosage, and duration of the treatment.
There may be other options available in rural health clinics. One would be post contraceptive advice which should include an overview of the risks, benefits, and side effects of the different contraceptive methods. The patient may also be interested in other support services available in the clinic like STI testing, cervical cancer screening, and HIV testing.
There is nothing else notable about this case. [1,3,5,7]
