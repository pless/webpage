
 The patient was presenting for treatment for Cough and catarrh. This was not particularly unreasonable, given the differential. However, the treatment plan recommended Avipol, Emvit C, and Emzolyn Child medications which are not typical for managing these symptoms in rural health clinics, as they are not essential medications and are not readily available. Rather, local sources should be exhausted first, such as cough and cold medications; if there are persistent cough or cold symptoms, he should be referred to a general hospital. [/Inst] This patient's case is consistent with the treatment plan recommended. However, considering the patient has been brought to a rural health clinic, referral should be considered to a general hospital. The recommended medications are not readily available in most rural areas for management of Catarrh, and other coughs in a setting without an adequate medication supply. Local resources should also be used first, such as cough and cold medicine. Further action should be taken before giving more intricate and less accessible medications.
