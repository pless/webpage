
The diagnosis of Priamary Pulmonary Hypertension seems to be consistent with the patient's history of Hypertension, and the Physical Examination findings. This condition requires long-term follow-up and regular monitoring of her Blood pressure and right heart failure parameters. In this context, the prescription of Amlodiphine to her as an antihypertensive seems appropriate. However, there may need to be a review of the patient's secondary prevention strategies.
The notes provided are an example of a patient with Hypertension who presents with Primary Pulmonary Hypertension. It is important to consider the high blood pressure as a major risk factor for many Cardiovascular events. A primary goal for managing hypertension is often to reduce the cardiovascular risk, through lifestyle changes and where necessary, pharmacotherapy.  

In summary, the next step would be to ensure the patient understands her condition and is advised on proper lifestyle interventions to manage her hypertension. She should also get more frequent follow-up to assess the efficacy of her hypertension treatment and to look out for signs of right heart failure or exacerbation of primary Pulmonary Hypertension. This could possibly include regular blood pressure checks, renal and lipid profiles, electrocardiogram, and spirometry every 6-12 months, depending on the progression of her disease.
