Firstly, the treatment is not consistent with the diagnosis. Amlodipine is an antihypertensive medication typically used to treat high blood pressure and angina, not primary pulmonary hypertension. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is usually treated with medications such as endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, or prostanoids.

Secondly, the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension is not consistent with the observations. The patient is a known hypertensive, and the blood pressure reading is within the prehypertension range, but there are no symptoms or signs mentioned that would suggest PPH, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, or a rapid heartbeat.

Thirdly, for this patient, I would recommend an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check for signs of heart disease. A chest x-ray might also be helpful to check for signs of lung disease. Both of these tests are usually available in rural health clinics. Additionally, if the facilities are available, an echocardiogram would also be useful to visualize the heart and assess its functioning.

Lastly, it's notable that the patient's blood pressure seems to be fairly well controlled at this visit, despite the diagnosis of hypertension. It would be important to monitor this regularly to ensure it remains within a healthy range.
