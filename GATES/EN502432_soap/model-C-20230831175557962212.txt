
Consistency of treatment with the diagnosis is excellent. Hypertensive heart disease would also require blood pressure control, but this case has a more specific diagnosis. Medications available in a rural health centre would likely include amlodipine for hypertension. There are however potentially other secondary causes of worsening renal disease in Primary pulmonary hypertension, such as connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome types III and IV, although these would not be common in a rural area. It would be relevant to consider the potential for secondary causes of renal disease. [/INST] This patient presented with a known case of Primary pulmonary hypertension with a follow-up appointment for her blood pressure as an additional diagnostic step, suggesting that this is not her first episode (follow-up). The patient, therefore, has a diagnosis consistent with the observed signs and symptoms, and the treatment is appropriate for managing her hypertension, a co-morbidity of Primary pulmonary hypertension. There could be other additional tests that could be useful to do in this instance, such as urinalysis, which could potentially show proteinuria as a manifestation of the disease. There could also be other causes of renal disease, such as lupus, but it would need a more specific investigation to say with surety. Further investigation or referral should be considered in this particular case in the event there are other underlying conditions. A follow-up plan should be arranged to monitor the patient's management.
