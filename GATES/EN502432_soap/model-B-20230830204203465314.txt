  Of course, I'd be happy to help you review the interaction you had with the patient! Based on the information provided in the notes you sent, here are my answers to your 4 questions:
1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment plan of prescribing Amlodipine 5mg tablets daily for 14 days is consistent with the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is commonly used to treat hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.
2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension is consistent with the patient's history of known hypertension and the physical examination findings of blood pressure of 136/76 mmHg.
3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
In rural health clinics, some additional tests that might be useful in diagnosing and managing primary pulmonary hypertension include:
* Echocardiography: This test can provide information on the structure and function of the heart, including the pulmonary artery pressure and flow.
* Right heart catheterization: This test can provide direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressure and can help confirm the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension.
* Complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry tests: These tests can help rule out other causes of hypertension, such as anemia or kidney disease.
* Chest X-ray: This test can help rule out other cardiovascular conditions, such as coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy.
4. Is there anything else notable?
Yes, it is notable that the patient has a follow-up appointment scheduled for May 31, 2023. It would be important to ensure that the patient attends this appointment and that any further tests or treatments are administered as needed. Additionally, it might be helpful to consider referrals to specialists, such as cardiologists or pulmonologists, for further evaluation and management of the patient's condition.
