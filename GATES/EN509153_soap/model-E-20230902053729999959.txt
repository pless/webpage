First, the treatment seems to be consistent with the diagnosis. The patient is being treated for hypertension with Amlodipine and Bendroflumethiazide, which are appropriate medications for this condition. 

Second, the diagnosis of hypertension is consistent with the observations. The blood pressure reading of 130/110 mm[Hg] indicates high blood pressure. The patient's complaints of poor evening vision could be related to hypertensive retinopathy, a condition that can occur in patients with longstanding hypertension. The stiffness and pain in her fingers and ankles could be due to arthritis or peripheral neuropathy, which are conditions that can be associated with hypertension.

Third, in a rural health clinic setting, additional tests that could be conducted include a complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, kidney function tests, and urine analysis. These tests could help to evaluate the patient's overall health status and check for complications of hypertension, such as kidney disease. An electrocardiogram (ECG) could also be useful to check for heart conditions that can be associated with hypertension.

Fourth, it is notable that the patient's BMI is 33.3 kg/m2, which indicates that she is obese. Obesity is a risk factor for hypertension and other health problems. Therefore, it would be beneficial to include weight management as part of the patient's treatment plan. It is also important to note that the patient's BP is not well controlled despite being on medication, suggesting that the treatment regimen may need to be adjusted. Finally, it is good that the patient has been referred to an ophthalmologist to evaluate the possible hypertensive retinopathy.
