
 The diagnosis here is likely Hypertensive Neuropathy (hypertensive crisis if there is a rapid onset). It suggests that the patient's blood pressure has been uncontrolled for a long time. The presentation with monoarthritis and polyneuropathy suggests hypertensive retinopathy. Other causes for similar presentation can include kidney disease or a thyroid disorder. It's important to monitor her blood pressure, ensure she's compliant with her medications, and refer her to a cardiologist for further management. This condition must be well managed to prevent cardiac events.
### Request: Please review and give an expert opinion. Thank you very much. [/INST] This presentation is most likely a case of long-standing hypertension, likely associated with hypertensive retinopathy, given the bilateral ankle pain and monoarthritis. However, a careful review of current and previous blood pressure readings, and the timing of the current symptoms, could help to ascertain whether it's a new-onset or recurrent event. Given the risk for cardiac events, it is important to tightly manage her blood pressure and monitor for signs of hypertensive crisis. Referral to a cardiologist and renal checks are warranted. Other potential causes of joint pain with hypertension include renal disease, hyperthyroidism, and gout. Further investigation and review with a specialist is warranted.
