  Great, I'd be happy to help you review the interaction you had with the patient. Here are my answers to your 4 questions:
1. Consistency of treatment with the diagnosis: The treatment plan you proposed for the patient is consistent with the diagnosis of hypertension and peripheral neuropathy. The patient is already on Amlodipine and Bendroflumethiazide, which are both antihypertensive medications that can help manage the patient's hypertension. The addition of Norvasc (Amlodipine) will help to further lower the patient's blood pressure.
2. Consistency of diagnosis with observations: The patient's history of hypertension and recent onset of stiffness in the fingers and ankle pain are consistent with the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. The patient's history of TIA (transient ischemic attack) two years ago also supports the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy.
3. Other tests that might be available in rural health clinics: In a rural health clinic, some other tests that might be available to help diagnose and manage peripheral neuropathy include:
* Electromyography (EMG): This test measures the electrical activity of muscles and can help diagnose nerve damage.
* Nerve conduction studies (NCS): This test measures the speed and strength of electrical signals in nerves and can help diagnose nerve damage.
* Urine tests: Urine tests can help identify underlying conditions such as diabetes or kidney disease that may be contributing to the patient's peripheral neuropathy.
* Blood tests: Blood tests can help identify underlying conditions such as vitamin deficiencies or autoimmune disorders that may be contributing to the patient's peripheral neuropathy.
4. Anything else notable: The patient's history of TIA two years ago is notable, as it suggests a higher risk of stroke. The patient should be advised to follow up with a neurologist to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the TIA. Additionally, the patient's BMI of 33.3 kg/m2 is elevated, which may be a risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, and other comorbidities. The patient should be advised to follow a healthy diet and exercise program to help manage their weight.
