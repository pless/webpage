
 This patient's clinical presentation, history, and physical findings are consistent with gastro- oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rather than a peptic ulcer, as there is no evidence of peptic ulcer symptoms, like gastritis, hiccup, or melena. GERD, also known as acid reflux disease, occurs when the LES, a ring of muscular cells that separates the esophagus from the stomach, weakens or relaxes and allows stomach contents to flow back up into the esophagus, causing symptoms. This patient should be counseled on the diagnosis, and a repeat H. pylori test might be beneficial before she starts taking medication. She should be encouraged to stop smoking, and the management plan should be reviewed.
