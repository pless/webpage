1. The treatment plan seems consistent with the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Omeprazole and Mg Trisilicate are appropriate medications for managing GERD, and stopping Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is also a good step as it can cause or worsen stomach irritation. B-Complex vitamins can help with overall health and well-being.

2. The diagnosis of GERD is consistent with the patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and excessive salivation. These symptoms, particularly when occurring after a long period of not eating, can be indicative of GERD. 

3. In a rural health clinic setting, the following additional tests could be considered: 
   - A complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia or infection.
   - A urine analysis to rule out kidney issues, which could be relevant given the patient’s history of hypertension and diabetes.
   - A stool test for occult blood, which could indicate bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.
   - An HbA1c test to monitor the patient's diabetes control.

4. One notable point is the patient's hypertensive condition with a recorded blood pressure of 147/85 mm[Hg]. This is above the ideal range and suggests that her hypertension is not well controlled. Furthermore, the patient's BMI of 26.8 kg/m2 indicates overweight, which could contribute to her health issues. It's also important to note that the patient's diabetes and hypertension, combined with the abnormal cold sensation under her feet, may suggest peripheral neuropathy. This should be investigated further. The daily use of Diclofenac could also be a concern due to its potential side effects, including kidney damage and stomach ulcers, especially with long-term use.
