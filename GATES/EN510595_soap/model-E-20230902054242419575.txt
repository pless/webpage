1. The treatment plan is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient has been diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and the treatment plan includes artemether-lumefantrine, which is a first-line treatment for this type of malaria. Paracetamol has also been prescribed to help manage the patient's fever and headache symptoms.

2. The diagnosis is generally consistent with the observations. The patient presented with fever and headache, which are common symptoms of malaria. However, additional symptoms such as chills, sweating, fatigue, and body aches are also common in malaria and were not reported in this case. The Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for malaria was also done, which likely confirmed the diagnosis.

3. Additional tests that could be done in a rural health clinic could include a complete blood count (CBC) to assess the patient's overall health and to look for signs of anemia, which is common in severe malaria. A blood smear could also be done to confirm the type of malaria parasite and to assess the severity of the infection.

4. One notable thing is that the patient is relatively young (13 years old) and may be more susceptible to severe illness from malaria. It would be important to monitor the patient closely to ensure the treatment is effective and that the patient is recovering. Additionally, while the patient's blood pressure is within normal range for his age, the level of distress reported could be of concern and should be monitored.
