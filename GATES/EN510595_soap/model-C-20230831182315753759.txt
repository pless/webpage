However, it is crucial to confirm the diagnosis with Parasitological confirmation, which can be performed with a blood film or fast test kit. However, these tests are not always available in rural health clinics, and RDTs are a reliable option. In addition to antimalarials, paracetamol can help with headache. Further investigation would include ensuring there are no other underlying causes of fever, like typhoid or bacterial meningitis. It is also important to ensure proper rest and adequate hydration for the patient. It's possible the patient might need a blood transfusion if the anemia is severe, even though it was not done in this case. Note that it's not ideal to advise on paracetamol use, as the potential risk of renal damage is significant. Lastly, this patient was given artemether lumefantrine, a first-line antimalarial, as per WHO recommendations.
