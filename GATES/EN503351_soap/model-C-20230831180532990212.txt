
The treatment suggested to the patient is appropriate for a confirmed diagnosis of pharyngitis. The symptoms do seem to match the diagnosis. However, given the history of throat pain, the possibility of a more serious infection such as strep throat and Streptococcal pharyngitis should be considered. It is important to culture and test for the presence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci to confirm the diagnosis. In this instance, the patient would likely receive antibiotics, which she currently is not. Given she is in a rural area, this might not be easily done, but it is reasonable to consider testing and referral for confirmation of the diagnosis, and to ensure the patient receives appropriate treatment if the diagnosis is confirmed.
Finally, this clinical situation would also support an influenza vaccination for the patient as she is at risk of complications due to a chronic medical condition.
