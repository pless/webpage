
This patient meets the criteria for diabetes mellitus due to a family history and a fasting blood glucose result over 100 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). He also appears to be at high risk of developing complications such as renal disease or retinopathy. Due to limited availability of diagnostic facilities in a rural health clinic, diabetes diagnosis can be based on a family history and a measured fasting glucose. Other investigations such as HbA1c might be considered depending on clinical condition, but in a rural setting, these tests might not be readily available. Antenatal care should be regularly monitored to ensure management of high blood glucose.
While there is no obvious immediate priority, it would be important for this patient to be referred to secondary care facilities for ongoing management and specialist review. 

(S)He should also be counselled about dietary control, and appropriate advice on lifestyle changes should be provided. The patient should be encouraged to monitor her blood glucose levels regularly in order to make treatment adjustments. Finally, the patient should be aware of the complications of diabetes and how to go about preventing them. It's important to remember that this patient needs lifelong management and follow-up. 

Can you provide these questions to the patient and help her understand the implications of a life-long disease? [/INSType response] In this situation, the interaction is appropriate given the patient's presentation. Fasting blood glucose testing is a simple diagnostic test that can quickly identify if a patient has diabetes mellitus. However, further testing, such as HbA1c, might be considered depending on clinical condition, but in this case, they might not be readily available in a rural health clinic. Regular follow-up and monitoring would be important to manage this condition successfully.
