Most cases of acute bronchitis are self-limiting but do require rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medication for fever and pain. Given a lack of availability of pneumococcal vaccine in rural areas, it is unlikely to be effective here. There are no other pertinent tests here as it appears this is an acute episode. One thing you might consider is the patients' adherence to treatment and lifestyle factors—for example, cessation of smoking and avoiding exposure to asthma triggers—in order to manage their condition and prevent subsequent exacerbations.
