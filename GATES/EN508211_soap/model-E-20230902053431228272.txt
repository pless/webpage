Based on the information provided:

1. The treatment seems consistent with the diagnosis. The patient has been diagnosed with chronic knee pain, likely due to arthritis. The prescribed treatment includes pain relief medication (Co-Codamol) and Vitamin C, which has anti-inflammatory properties and can potentially reduce symptoms of arthritis.

2. The diagnosis seems consistent with the observations. The patient is suffering from severe knee pain, particularly at night, and has been experiencing this for a long time. There was no noted trauma or sudden fall, and no tenderness or warmth was detected in the knee, which could indicate an inflammatory process like arthritis.

3. In a rural health clinic setting, the proposed tests, including checking uric acid levels and considering an X-ray of the knee if pain persists, are appropriate. Uric acid levels could help rule out gout, another potential cause of severe knee pain. If resources allow, testing for Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) might also be helpful to further confirm arthritis.

4. It's notable that the patient is a known hypertensive, and his blood pressure at the time of the examination was 100/70 mmHg, which is within the normal range. It's important to ensure that the patient's hypertension is well-managed, as this condition can contribute to other health issues. The patient also complained of right ocular pain post-surgery for four years, which is not addressed in the treatment plan. This issue should be further explored and addressed.
