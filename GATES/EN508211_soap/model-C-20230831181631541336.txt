
 This patient likely has arthritis. The presentation of progressive bilateral knee pain over five years is suggestive of OA. This is supported by the patient's self-report of the pain increasing at night. It's essential to perform a knee examination such as the Ottawa knee exam to confirm the diagnosis. Consideration of a knee X-ray is also advised to confirm the diagnosis. The patient may also benefit from a structured exercise program. The pain can be managed using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), but the management should be regularly reviewed, because of the potential for adverse effects. Also, consider referral to a rheumatologist for further management if necessary. It's important to ensure the patient understands his condition and follows up instructions, and lifestyle changes if necessary due to the chronic nature of osteoarthritis management, diet, weight loss, exercise, and smoking (if applicable) should be discussed. The patient should also be informed of the common signs of complications of osteoarthritis such as worsening knee pain, swelling, redness, fever, difficulty joint range of motion or new loss of weight. If these symptoms persist or worsen, he should consult again.
