
This patient presents with a concerning feature - lower abdominal pain is common in a range of serious underlying disorders such as appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, sepsis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and even ovarian torsion. While I do not think there is an emergency, I would not rely entirely on the patient's self-report of her pain. I would do a rectal exam to evaluate for tenderness, and possibly order a pelvic ultrasound, if available. If she shows signs of sepsis, like tachycardia and hypertension, or if her symptoms deteriorate, you should consider sending her to the hospital for urgent evaluation.
### Quality Improvement: You could improve patient care by reinforcing the need for adequate pain control and seeking a second opinion on other differential diagnoses in such a complex case.
