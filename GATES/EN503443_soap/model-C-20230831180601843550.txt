
 Given the patient's symptoms of chest pain suggesting potentially complications of heart attack or other cardiovascular conditions, you should order a troponin level immediately along with other cardiac markers. If the troponin result reaches above 10 ng/mL, then you would further order an echocardiogram to assess for myocardial thickening. It would be safe to initiate treatment without immediate confirmation of the diagnosis based on the symptom and medical history as the immediate threat to life is from the peptic ulcer but not the chest pain, given it's too early for a heart attack.
