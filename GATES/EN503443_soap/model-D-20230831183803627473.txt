
 The diagnosis seems consistent with the presenting symptoms and past history of stomach ulcers. However, given the patient's chest pain, you should evaluate for conditions other than gastritis, such as pneumonia. You could also consider tests like blood counts for anemia or hemoglobin level, liver function studies, and possibly a chest X-ray. In a rural health clinic, these tests might not be available, so another strategy could be to prescribe more antacids and gastric protectants in combination with lifestyle modifications and recommend a more advanced evaluation at a general hospital.
