
 The treatment plan is appropriate for a cough, given it is a common symptom of seasonal acute respiratory infections. Prescription of antibiotics or anti-tuberculosis drugs would be overzealous given the diagnosis. Her symptoms and overall presentation are consistent with acute bronchitis, given the recent exposure to bronchitis. However, if she has had a persistent lung infection for more than three weeks that hasn't responded to treatment, you should consider other possibilities, such as a chronic lung disease. Other tests, such as spirometry to confirm or rule out asthma, would not be available in a rural health clinic, but it would be worth exploring if the cough persists after about three weeks. Noting that any history of previous or active severe illness, fever, chest pain, severe unexplained weight loss, or unexplained swelling could change the course of management. The patient was reported to be feeling "Mild distress" which could be interpreted as significant enough to warrant closer follow-up.
