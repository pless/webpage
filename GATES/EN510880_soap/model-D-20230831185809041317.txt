
The treatment plan is appropriate. It includes culture and sensitivity to determine the appropriate antibiotic. The observation of passing urine with fever suggests a urinary tract infection. This is supported by the urinalysis. The patient's age and immunization status are a positive feature. It is good that the mother is aware of the symptoms and has brought the child in at the early stage when intervention can be more effective. An analysis of the urine to determine the site of infection would enhance the diagnostic assessment. The investigation plan covers a full urinalysis and blood/urinary protein.

I would recommend continuing to monitor the patient until the urinalysis results are available. If the urine shows blood, protein, or other infection indicators, further management should be guided by those results. Further, depending on the site and extent of the infection, it may also require antibiotic broader than what was initially considered but what will be shown on urinalysis. The investigation is already a good starting point. The fever and crying while passing urine should be further assessed for the source of infection. [End of Response]
