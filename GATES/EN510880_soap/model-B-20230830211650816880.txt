  Sure, I'd be happy to help you review the interaction you had with the patient. Here are my answers to your 4 questions:
1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment plan you provided is consistent with the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). Syrup PCM 70mg TDS is an antibiotic commonly used to treat UTIs, and the instruction to collect a urine sample for urinalysis is also appropriate.
2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the diagnosis of UTI is consistent with the patient's history of fever and change in urine temperature. The patient's age and the fact that he is adequately breastfeeding also support this diagnosis.
3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
Yes, in addition to urinalysis, you might consider testing the patient's urine for leukocytes and nitrites, which can help confirm the diagnosis of UTI. You could also consider testing the patient's blood for pyelonephritis, which is a more severe form of UTI that can occur if the infection spreads to the kidneys. These tests may not be available in all rural health clinics, but they are important to consider if the patient's condition warrants further evaluation.
4. Is there anything else notable?
Yes, it is notable that the patient is only 3 months old and has a fever that is high and intermittent. This could be a sign of a more serious infection, and it is important to monitor the patient's condition closely and consider further evaluation if necessary. Additionally, the patient's mother has noticed a change in the baby's urine temperature, which could be a sign of dehydration or another underlying condition. It is important to monitor the patient's hydration status and consider further evaluation if necessary.
