
It's possible that the patient has appendicitis. However, this diagnosis is uncertain, and a definitive diagnosis cannot be made based on this single presentation. Considerations for next steps include urgent referral to a center with imaging facilities or immediate transfer before this reaches a critical stage.
It is important to keep in mind that the majority of patients with appendicitis have symptoms more typical of an acute right lower quadrant abdominal infection, with pain that typically begins in the right upper quadrant and gradually shifts.
You should order the following tests: The laboratory investigation should include fasting blood glucose, liver function tests, blood electrolytes, and a complete blood count if there is any concerning symptoms. Ultrasonography and other imaging of the abdomen (e.g., Computed Tomography) should also be ordered to rule out any other serious causes of her symptoms.
Other differential diagnoses are urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, gastritis, irinotecan-induced mucositis, pancreatitis, and other types of inflammatory conditions of the abdomen. [4]  [5]  [6].

### Remarks: The risk of surgical complications is higher in rural areas where equipment and facilities may be less well-equipped or where infection rates are higher. This calls for early presentation to an appropriate surgical facility after urgent referral. It is essential to maintain excellent communication with the referring physician. The patient should be informed of the high risk of surgical complications in her area, including sepsis and organ failure, the importance of being in an area with high-quality surgical facilities (if feasible), and the high likelihood of death if she is not urgently referred. [7].
It would be beneficial to discuss the issues, particularly those related to the timeliness and quality of her treatment, openly with the patient and the community. Encourage the patient to tell family and friends about her symptoms.

Diagnostic Evaluation. The diagnostic evaluation would include at a minimum fasting blood glucose, liver function tests, blood electrolytes, a complete blood count, and possibly imaging of the abdomen. [4] [6].
Imaging. Initial imaging of the abdomen was probably a non-specific ultrasonography. If a CT was conducted, the next step would be to review the images with the referring physician. If the diagnosis is not confirmed, a CT enteroclysis with oral contrast may be suggested. [6].
Surgical intervention with early referral. The patient was referred to a center with imaging facilities, where further evaluation and potential laparotomy of the abdomen can be undertaken, depending on the outcome of the imaging studies. [7].
Other potentially life-threatening causes of abdominal pain, including sepsis, must be considered in this patient's case, especially given her age and background. [4].
