  Based on the information provided, here are my answers to your questions:
1. Consistency of treatment with diagnosis: The treatment plan recommended by the health worker is consistent with the diagnosis of impetigo, which is a bacterial skin infection that requires wound debridement and disinfection, and antibiotic therapy.
2. Consistency of diagnosis with observations: The patient's symptoms and signs, such as the presence of pimples on the forehead, bursting and spreading of the rash, swelling of the eyelids, and redness and tenderness of the skin, are consistent with the diagnosis of impetigo.
3. Other tests that might be available in rural health clinics: In a rural health clinic, other tests that might be available to diagnose impetigo include:
* Blood cultures: To rule out sepsis or bacteremia.
* Wound swab cultures: To identify the bacterial cause of the infection.
* Complete blood count (CBC): To evaluate for signs of infection or inflammation.
* Urinalysis: To evaluate for signs of urinary tract infection.
* Chest X-ray: To evaluate for signs of pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
* Stool culture: To evaluate for signs of gastrointestinal infection.
4. Anything else notable: The patient's history of using traditional medicine and the absence of similar symptoms in his social contacts suggest that the infection may be a localized one, and the use of traditional medicine may not have been effective in treating the infection. Additionally, the patient's recent weight loss and the presence of swelling of the eyelids suggest that there may be an underlying systemic infection that needs to be evaluated and treated.
