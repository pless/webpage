Though impetigo frequently accompanies or follows insect stings or bites, which was negative in this case, it's also possible it could occur after non-insect sources of envenomation (like snake or spider bites), a reaction to non-insect systemic illnesses, or other conditions. This diagnosis is supported by the presenting history of swelling, pus forming bullae, redness, and swelling on the frontal area of the body. The differentials include unspecified local infection of skin and subcutaneous tissue, but it is unlikely given that there are no other symptoms such as fever or discomfort. Antibiotics like diclofenac are insufficient for treating secondary bacterial infections of impetigo. Systemic antibiotics like co-amoxiclav would be better for this case and should be considered. Follow-up is crucial to monitor for any worsening symptoms and prevent transmission to others, especially children, in the community.
### Input from the respondent: The findings are consistent with impetigo, a skin infection that is relatively common worldwide. Given the appearance of skin lesions, antibiotic cream application would be necessary. Considering the patient visited a traditional medicine man before seeing you may have caused a delay in proper treatment. It's vital to educate patients about proper wound care, especially when they engage in self-treatment or consult other sources. This will help prevent the spread of impetigo in the community. You might consider obtaining culture results to guide antibiotic choices, given the possibility of secondary bacterial infections.
