First, the treatment plan seems to be consistent with the diagnosis of Impetigo. Impetigo is a common skin infection that's often caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus bacteria. It's often treated with cleaning the wound and applying topical antibiotics, which are included in the treatment plan. 

Second, the diagnosis of Impetigo is consistent with the observations. The patient's symptoms of itchy, painful rashes that burst and spread, along with pustules and crusty lesions, are commonly associated with this condition. 

Third, in terms of other tests, in a rural setting, a Gram stain of the pus or crust might be done if available. This can help identify the bacteria causing the infection. Also, it might be helpful to do a complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of an increased white blood cell count which can indicate an infection. However, these tests might not be available in a rural health clinic.

Fourth, it's notable that the patient has been self-medicating with diclofenac and traditional medicine. It's important to discuss the potential risks and interactions of these treatments with the patient. Additionally, the swelling of the eyelids could potentially indicate a more serious infection, so it's crucial to monitor this symptom closely. If the swelling continues or the patient develops vision problems, they should be referred to a higher level of care if possible.
