  Based on the information provided, here are my answers to your questions:
1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment plan for the patient involves reassurance, wound irrigation, debridement, and disinfection with Savlon, which are appropriate measures for managing impetigo.
2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the patient's symptoms of rashes, swelling, and eyelid swelling are consistent with impetigo. The observation of pustules on the forehead and temples also supports the diagnosis.
3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
In a rural health clinic setting, other tests that might be useful in confirming the diagnosis of impetigo include:
* Blood cultures: To rule out bacterial infections or sepsis
* Skin scrapings: To confirm the presence of bacteria or fungi causing the infection
* Pusture biopsy: To evaluate the severity of the infection and assess the response to treatment
* Complete blood count (CBC): To evaluate for any systemic symptoms or signs of infection
4. Is there anything else notable?
Yes, it is notable that the patient has a history of using traditional medicine, which may have contributed to the delay in seeking medical attention. It is also worth considering other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as allergic reactions or insect bites, which may need to be evaluated and treated accordingly.
