1. The treatment seems consistent with the diagnosis since the patient is having poor vision and a referral for low vision aid is appropriate.

2. The diagnosis isn't consistent with the observations. The patient has a history of fever with convulsions, but the diagnosis is not clear. 

3. A malaria test could be beneficial considering the history of fever. Also, a urine analysis test may help in identifying any abnormalities. 

4. The note lacks a differential diagnosis. It's crucial to have one to rule out other possible conditions that could be causing the patient's symptoms.

5. Poor vision could be a sign of a serious problem like a brain tumor, especially with a history of convulsions. The clinic may not have the necessary equipment to rule this out, in which case the patient should be referred to a higher-level facility.

6. Questions to ask: 
- "Can you describe your vision problems? Are they constant or do they come and go?"
- "Did the vision problems start after the fever and convulsions?"
- "Have you had any recent head injuries?"
- "Are there any other symptoms?"
Most attentive to answers that suggest persistent or worsening vision problems, symptoms indicating neurological issues (headaches, dizziness), or a correlation between the vision problems and the past fever/convulsions.
