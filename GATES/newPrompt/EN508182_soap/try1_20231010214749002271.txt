1. The treatment seems consistent with the diagnosis, as poor vision is being addressed with low vision aid. However, the diagnosis of "Others" is unclear.

2. The diagnosis is not consistent with the observations. The history of fever with convulsions in childhood may suggest potential neurological issues, which may not directly relate to poor vision.

3. A malaria or typhoid test might be helpful if the fever and convulsions were due to one of these diseases, as they can affect vision. 

4. Notable is the lack of a clear diagnosis and the patient's history of fever and convulsions, which may suggest a neurological condition.

5. These symptoms could be a sign of a serious problem such as a neurological disorder or infection. If possible, referring the patient to a larger hospital for neurological evaluation would be ideal.

6. Ask the patient if the vision problem is progressive or sudden, and if there are other symptoms such as headaches or dizziness. Also ask about any family history of vision problems or neurological conditions. Be attentive to progressive vision loss or other neurological symptoms, and any positive family history.
