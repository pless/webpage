Without the diagnosis and treatment plan, it's impossible to evaluate whether the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. 

Based on the symptoms, a urine analysis could be useful to rule out a urinary tract infection, which can cause abdominal pain. 

Without a diagnosis or treatment plan, it's hard to say if there's anything else notable or if these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem. 

Ask the patient about the exact location of the pain, what it feels like (sharp, dull, cramping?), and if it's associated with any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever. If the pain is in the lower right abdomen, appendicitis could be a concern. If it is a sharp, severe pain, it could be a sign of a more serious issue like an ectopic pregnancy or kidney stones. 

Also, ask if she is sexually active and using any birth control, if she has had any changes in her menstrual cycle, and if she has had a similar pain in the past. Be attentive to answers that suggest the pain is severe, worsening, or associated with other concerning symptoms.
