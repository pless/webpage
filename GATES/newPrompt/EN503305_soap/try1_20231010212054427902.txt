Without the Diagnosis, Differential Diagnosis and Treatment plan, it is impossible to evaluate if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. 

However, based on the symptoms alone, additional tests that could be helpful include a Urine analysis to check for UTI or kidney stones, and possibly a Malaria or Typhoid test if she has other symptoms like fever, chills, etc. 

Abdominal pain can be a sign of several serious conditions like appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, kidney stones, etc. Further tests and a thorough physical examination (focusing on the abdomen) are needed to rule these out. 

Ask the patient:
1. "Is the pain localized or spread out across your abdomen?" - localized pain might indicate issues like appendicitis or gallstones.
2. "Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or urination?" - changes here could suggest problems with the digestive or urinary system.
3. "Are you sexually active and could there be a chance you are pregnant?" - this could help rule out ectopic pregnancy.
4. "Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss?" - these symptoms could suggest more serious conditions like infections or cancers.
