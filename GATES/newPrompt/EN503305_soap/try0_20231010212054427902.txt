The information provided is insufficient to answer the questions. The diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment plan sections are blank. The patient's symptoms, abdominal pain, could indicate a range of conditions from mild to serious. It would be helpful to have more information about the nature, location, and timing of the pain. For instance, asking "Is the pain constant or does it come and go?" and "Does the pain get worse after eating or at certain times of day?" could be informative. If the patient reports worsening pain, vomiting, or fever, these could be signs of a serious condition such as appendicitis. Without more information, it's difficult to suggest which tests might be useful. However, given the resources, a urine analysis could help rule out a urinary tract infection, which can cause abdominal pain.
