1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The recommended treatment for this condition includes artemether lumefantrine, which has been prescribed.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient presented with fever and headache, which are common symptoms of malaria, and a positive malaria RDT supports the diagnosis.

3. Given the resources available, no additional tests seem necessary. The diagnosis of malaria is confirmed by the RDT, and the patient's symptoms align with this diagnosis.

4. Notable is the lack of differential diagnoses. While malaria is likely given the positive RDT, other conditions can coexist or mimic malaria. However, with the limited resources, it may be challenging to explore further.

5. These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem such as meningitis or encephalitis. However, these are unlikely given the positive malaria test and the absence of neurological symptoms. To rule them out completely, a lumbar puncture would be needed which seems not available.

6. Questions to ask: 
   - Has the patient noticed any changes in vision or hearing? (Any positive response should be noted as this could indicate a more serious condition.)
   - Has the patient experienced any seizures? (Seizures could suggest a more severe illness such as meningitis or cerebral malaria.)
   - Has the patient been taking any medication at home for the fever? (Important to avoid drug interactions or overdosing.)
