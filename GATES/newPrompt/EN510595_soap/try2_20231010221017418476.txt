1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations of fever and headache.
3. A typhoid test may be helpful, as the symptoms of typhoid can overlap with malaria.
4. Notable is that the patient is acutely ill and in moderate distress. 
5. These symptoms could be a sign of a more serious problem like meningitis. To rule this out, observe for neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, or altered mental status. If these can't be ruled out, the patient should be referred to a higher level of care.
6. Ask the patient if they have a stiff neck or sensitivity to light. Also ask if they've noticed any changes in their behavior or consciousness. For all these questions, a "yes" response should be given serious attention.
