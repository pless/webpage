First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient is being referred for specialist review and high risk antenatal care, which is appropriate given the recurrent miscarriages and the threatened current pregnancy.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The history of multiple miscarriages, current symptoms, and ultrasound findings support the diagnosis of recurrent miscarriage and possible threatened miscarriage.

Third, a urine analysis test could be beneficial to rule out urinary tract infection which could be causing right sided lower abdominal pain and yellowish PV discharge. 

Fourth, the history of PID could potentially play a role in her recurrent miscarriages. It's also notable that all miscarriages occurred after her second marriage which may suggest a possible issue with the new partner (genetic, etc).

Fifth, recurrent miscarriages can be a sign of serious problems like genetic disorders, hormonal imbalances, uterine abnormalities, etc. Genetic counseling, hormonal assays, and detailed ultrasound for uterine abnormalities can rule out these issues. But if these tests are not available, she should be referred to a higher center.

Sixth, ask the patient if her new partner has had children before (to rule out genetic issues). Also, ask the patient about any history of diabetes or thyroid disorders in her family, as these can cause recurrent miscarriages. Be attentive to a negative history of children from the new partner and a positive history of diabetes or thyroid disorders in her family.
