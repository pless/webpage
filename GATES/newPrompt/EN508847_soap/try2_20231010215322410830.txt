1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient is being referred to a specialist for further review due to her history of recurrent abortions and the current threatened abortion.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has a history of multiple miscarriages and is currently experiencing symptoms of a threatened miscarriage.
3. A urine analysis might help assess for infections that could contribute to miscarriages. 
4. Notable is the patient's history of PID and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Both conditions could potentially impact pregnancy outcomes.
5. These symptoms could indicate an ectopic pregnancy or other serious reproductive health issues. An ultrasound could help rule out an ectopic pregnancy. If not possible, close monitoring and referral to a higher level of care is necessary.
6. Ask about the nature and timing of abdominal pain, as sudden or severe pain could indicate a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Also ask about the color and consistency of vaginal discharge, as foul-smelling or unusual discharge could indicate an infection. Be attentive to any reports of severe pain or abnormal discharge.
