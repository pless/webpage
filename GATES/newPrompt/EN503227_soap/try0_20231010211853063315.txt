Second, the diagnosis is also not provided, so it's impossible to verify if it's consistent with the observations.

Fourth, it's important to note that the chest pain and backaches could be signs of a serious problem like heart disease, especially in women. 

Fifth, to rule out heart disease, you could ask if the pain spreads to the arm or jaw, if it's accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, or sweating, or if it worsens with activity. You should be most attentive to answers indicating that the pain is spreading, worsening with activity, or accompanied by other symptoms of heart disease. If we cannot rule out this, the patient should be referred to a hospital for further tests as soon as possible.

Sixth, ask the patient if she has any history of heart disease, if the pain is constant or intermittent, and if she has been experiencing any other symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, or palpitations. Be attentive to a positive history of heart disease, constant pain, and presence of other symptoms.
