As there's no information provided about the diagnosis and treatment plan, I can't assess if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. 

The symptoms of chest pain and backache can indicate various conditions, some of which can be serious, like heart disease. A chest X-ray and ECG would be ideal, but not available here. 

Anemia test could be helpful, as chest pain can be a symptom. 

Ask the patient: 
1. "Is the chest pain constant or does it come and go?" - Constant pain is more concerning.
2. "Does the pain worsen with physical activity?" - If yes, it could indicate a heart condition.
3. "Have you had similar pain before?" - A history of similar symptoms could indicate a chronic condition. 

Immediate referral to a better-equipped facility is necessary if heart disease can't be ruled out.
