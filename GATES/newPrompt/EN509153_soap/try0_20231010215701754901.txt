First, the treatment seems consistent with the diagnosis. The patient is being treated with Amlodipine and Bendro for hypertension, which matches their diagnosis.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient is known hypertensive, has a history of TIA, and is experiencing symptoms like poor vision and joint pain that could be related to hypertension or hypertensive retinopathy.

Third, a urine analysis might be helpful to rule out any kidney issues related to hypertension. 

Fourth, it's notable that the patient's blood pressure is still high (130/110) despite being on medication, indicating that the current treatment may not be fully effective.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to stroke, heart disease, or kidney failure. To rule this out, you could monitor the patient's blood pressure regularly and adjust their medication as necessary. 

Sixth, ask the patient: 
1) If they've been taking their medication as prescribed (non-compliance could explain the high BP). Be attentive if the patient admits to missing doses frequently. 
2) If they've noticed any changes in urination (could indicate kidney issues). Be attentive to reports of frequent urination, pain, or changes in color.
3) If they've experienced any severe headaches, chest pain, or shortness of breath (could indicate a hypertensive crisis). Be attentive to any affirmative answers.
