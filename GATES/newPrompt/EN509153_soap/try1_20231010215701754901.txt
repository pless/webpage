First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of hypertension. The patient is prescribed Amlodipine and Bendroflumethiazide, both of which are common medications for hypertension.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's high blood pressure, history of hypertension, and symptoms of poor evening vision and occasional joint pain could indicate hypertensive retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy.

Third, a urine analysis could be helpful to rule out kidney issues, which can be associated with longstanding hypertension. 

Fourth, the patient's BMI indicates obesity, which could be contributing to her hypertension and other health issues.

Fifth, these symptoms could potentially be signs of a more serious problem such as heart disease, kidney disease, or stroke. To rule these out, the patient should be monitored closely for worsening symptoms. 

Sixth, you could ask the patient about the nature and frequency of her joint pain, as well as any changes in her vision. If she reports severe, constant pain or sudden vision loss, these could indicate a more serious condition.
