First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observed symptoms of fever, dizziness, and headache.

Third, a typhoid test might be beneficial since typhoid can also present with similar symptoms as malaria.

Fourth, the patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, which could be due to the fever or stress from the illness.

Fifth, these symptoms can be signs of other serious problems such as meningitis or encephalitis. However, with limited resources, it might be difficult to rule these out. If symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should be referred to a better-equipped facility.

Sixth, ask the patient if she has any neck stiffness or sensitivity to light (indicative of meningitis), or any confusion or altered mental status (signs of encephalitis). Also, ask about recent travel or exposure to others who are ill, which could suggest other infectious diseases. Pay attention to positive answers to these questions.
