1. Yes, the treatment of paracetamol and rest is consistent with a tension-type headache diagnosis.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations of a headache and a history of hypertension.
3. No additional tests would be necessary for a tension headache. However, if symptoms persist, a urine analysis could be helpful to rule out other conditions.
4. Notable is the patient's history of hypertension. Ensure it's well-managed to avoid complications.
5. Persistent headaches can be signs of serious problems like brain tumors. However, without imaging equipment, this can't be ruled out. If symptoms persist or worsen, refer the patient to a better-equipped facility.
6. Ask the patient: a) "Have your headaches been increasing in frequency or severity?" Be attentive to 'yes'. b) "Have you noticed any other symptoms like blurred vision, confusion, or difficulty speaking?" Be attentive to 'yes'. These could indicate a more serious condition.
