First, the treatment appears to be symptomatic relief with paracetamol which is common for fever and headache, but a definitive diagnosis isn't provided.

Second, the diagnosis isn't mentioned, but the observations are consistent with several conditions including Malaria and Typhoid which are common in Nigeria.

Third, considering the symptoms and location, Malaria test would be helpful. If negative, a Typhoid test could be considered.

Fourth, the patient's age and symptoms could suggest a more serious condition. 

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like Meningitis, though this can't be tested for at the clinic. If symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should seek more advanced medical care.

Sixth, ask: 
1) "Have you experienced any changes in vision?" This can help rule out Meningitis. Be attentive to any affirmative answers.
2) "Have you noticed a rash or any other skin changes?" This can indicate more serious conditions. Look for descriptions of sudden or unusual rashes.
3) "Have you had similar symptoms in the past?" This can indicate a recurring condition. Be attentive to any history of similar episodes.
