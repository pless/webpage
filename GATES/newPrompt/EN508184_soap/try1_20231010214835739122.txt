First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, assuming the diagnosis is an eye allergy. 

Second, the diagnosis is not provided, so it is difficult to assess if it is consistent with the observations. 

Third, a vision test could be helpful to better understand the blurry vision in the right eye. 

Fourth, blood pressure is recorded as 100/0 mm[Hg], which is not normal. This should be clarified.

Fifth, blurry vision could be a sign of serious conditions such as glaucoma or retinal detachment. In this setting, it might be impossible to rule this out without further tests. The patient should be advised to seek more specialized care if possible.

Sixth, ask if the patient has experienced any eye pain, light sensitivity, or any recent trauma to the eye. If they answer yes to any of these, it could indicate a more serious condition. Also, ask about any family history of eye conditions, as certain diseases can be hereditary.
