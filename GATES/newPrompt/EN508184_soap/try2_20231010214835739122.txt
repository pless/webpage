1. The treatment is not consistent with the diagnosis. The diagnosis is not specified. The treatment seems to be for allergic conjunctivitis, but this is not diagnosed.

2. The diagnosis is not consistent with the observations. Blurry vision in one eye and itchiness in the other could indicate a range of issues, from allergies to more serious eye conditions.

3. A physical examination of the eyes would be helpful, including a visual acuity test and an examination of the interior and exterior of the eyes. The tests available at the clinic may not be helpful in this case.

4. Notable is the patient's young age and the duration of symptoms. The blood pressure reading is also incomplete.

5. These symptoms could be a sign of a serious problem such as glaucoma or a neurological issue. An ophthalmologist should examine the patient if possible. If not, refer the patient to a higher level of care.

6. Ask the patient if they have experienced any eye pain, light sensitivity, or headaches. Also ask about any history of eye problems in the family. Answers indicating severe pain, sudden onset, or a family history of serious eye conditions should be taken seriously.
