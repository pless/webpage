1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The patient is prescribed Omeprazole, which is a proton pump inhibitor used to reduce stomach acid.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and hypersalivation are indicative of Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

3. An H. Pylori test could be helpful to rule out Peptic ulcer disease, which is a differential diagnosis. 

4. The patient is hypertensive with a blood pressure of 147/85 mm[Hg] and diabetic. These conditions require ongoing management.

5. Yes, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem like a peptic ulcer or even gastric cancer. An H. Pylori test could rule out peptic ulcer disease. If symptoms persist, referral to a higher-level facility for endoscopy might be needed.

6. You should ask the patient:
- If there's a history of similar symptoms in the past? (A history of recurrent symptoms might suggest a chronic condition like GERD or peptic ulcer)
- If there's any relation between symptoms and food intake? (Symptoms that worsen on an empty stomach might suggest peptic ulcer disease)
- If there's any history of black, tarry stools or blood in vomit? (These signs suggest gastrointestinal bleeding which could be due to a peptic ulcer or gastric cancer).
