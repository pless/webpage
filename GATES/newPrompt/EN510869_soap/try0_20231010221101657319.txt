1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used to reduce stomach acid and treat GERD. 

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Symptoms of hypersalivation and nausea, as well as a history of diabetes and hypertension, are consistent with GERD. 

3. No additional tests seem necessary based on the information provided. However, the doctor plans to do a FBS (fasting blood sugar) test and consider an H. Pylori test, which are appropriate given the patient's history and symptoms.

4. The patient's blood pressure is on the higher end which is consistent with their hypertension diagnosis. Also, the patient's BMI falls within the overweight range which can contribute to GERD.

5. Yes, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem such as a peptic ulcer or even gastric cancer. An H. Pylori test can help rule out peptic ulcers. 

6. Questions to ask: 
   - "Have you noticed any blood in your vomit or stool?" (This could indicate a peptic ulcer or gastric cancer)
   - "Have you experienced any chest pain or difficulty swallowing?" (These could be signs of esophageal complications)
   - "Have your symptoms improved at all since starting the Omeprazole?" (This can help assess the effectiveness of the treatment).
