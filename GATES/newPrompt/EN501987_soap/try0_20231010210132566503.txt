1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms of fever, catarrh, and coughing.
3. A test for Malaria could be helpful given the symptom of fever.
4. The patient reports head pain, which could be from fever or another cause. This should be monitored.
5. These symptoms could be a sign of a more serious problem like Malaria. A Malaria test could help rule this out. If positive, appropriate anti-malarial treatment should be administered.
