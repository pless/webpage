1. The treatment of Buscopan (for abdominal pain) and Paracetamol (for back pain and body pain) is consistent with the symptoms, but not necessarily the diagnosis. The patient was tested for malaria which came back negative, and without a clear diagnosis, it's hard to say if the treatment is consistent. 

2. The diagnosis of malaria and gastroenteritis (GE) is not consistent with the observations. The patient tested negative for malaria and GE usually presents with vomiting and fever, which the patient does not have.

3. Given the symptoms of abdominal pain, back pain, and diarrhea, a Urine analysis could be helpful to rule out urinary tract infection. 

4. Notable is the bitterness of mouth which could be a symptom of liver or gallbladder disease. Also, the patient does not have a fever, which makes infections less likely.

5. These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like gallbladder or kidney disease. A urine analysis could help rule out kidney disease. If gallbladder disease is suspected and cannot be ruled out, referral to a hospital for an ultrasound would be next.

6. Ask the patient: 
- "Have you noticed any change in the color of your urine or stool?" Dark urine or light-colored stool could indicate a liver or gallbladder problem.
- "Does the pain get worse after eating?" Pain that worsens after eating can be a sign of gallbladder disease. 
- "Have you had any unexplained weight loss?" This could indicate a more serious underlying condition like cancer.
- "Have you noticed any blood in your stool?" This could indicate a serious condition like colon cancer or GI bleeding.
