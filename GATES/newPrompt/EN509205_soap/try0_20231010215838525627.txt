First, the treatment of Buscopan and PCM (paracetamol) is consistent with the diagnosis of abdominal pain and back pain, although the underlying cause isn't clear.

Second, the diagnosis isn't clear from the notes. The patient's symptoms could be due to several conditions, but the RDT is negative for Malaria. 

Third, a Urine analysis test would be helpful since the patient has abdominal and back pain. This may indicate a urinary tract infection or kidney problem.

Fourth, the patient has been experiencing symptoms for 3 days, which is relatively short. However, the patient doesn't have any known chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension.

Fifth, these symptoms can be signs of a serious problem like kidney disease or gastrointestinal issues. A urine analysis can help rule out kidney problems. If the urine analysis is negative, the patient may need to seek additional help outside the clinic.

Sixth, ask the patient if the abdominal pain is constant or comes in waves, and if there have been any changes in bowel movements or urination. For the back pain, ask if there is any numbness or tingling in the legs. Be attentive to answers indicating severe, constant abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements or urination, or any numbness or tingling.
