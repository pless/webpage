First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Loratadine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergies such as runny nose (catarrh).

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations - the chief complaint is catarrh, and the treatment prescribed is suitable for this complaint.

Third, no additional tests are required in this case. The patient's symptoms and age suggest a common cold or allergies, not a more serious condition that would necessitate the available tests.

Fourth, the notable thing here is that the duration of the catarrh, 5 days, is a bit long. If symptoms persist after the treatment, other causes should be considered.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a sinus infection or other respiratory issue. If the catarrh does not improve with treatment, further evaluation may be necessary. 

Sixth, questions to ask could include: 
1. "Has the child had a fever?" - a fever could indicate an infection.
2. "Has there been any change in behavior, such as lethargy or irritability?" - this could indicate a more serious illness.
3. "Has the child been around anyone with similar symptoms?" - this could indicate a contagious condition.
