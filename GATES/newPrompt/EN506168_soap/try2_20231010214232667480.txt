First, the treatment, Afrab Syrup which contains Loratadine, is consistent with the diagnosis as it is an antihistamine used for treating symptoms of allergies such as catarrh. 

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has a five-day history of catarrh which is a common symptom of an allergic reaction. 

Third, no additional tests seem necessary in this case as the symptoms and treatment align. 

Fourth, the note lacks a clear diagnosis and differential diagnosis. For better understanding and future reference, it is important to document these. 

Fifth, these symptoms could potentially be a sign of a respiratory infection or allergy. To rule out a more serious problem, monitor the patient's symptoms closely. If symptoms worsen or persist after treatment, refer the patient to a better-equipped health facility. 

Sixth, ask the following: 
1) Are there any other symptoms, like fever or cough? If yes, it may indicate an infection.
2) Has the patient been exposed to allergens or changed her environment recently? If yes, it could be an allergic reaction.
3) Has the patient been in contact with anyone with similar symptoms? If yes, it could indicate a contagious condition.
