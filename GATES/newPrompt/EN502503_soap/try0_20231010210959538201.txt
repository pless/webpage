First, the treatment of antihistamine, fever reducer, and vitamin C is consistent with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the subjective observations of fever and catarrh.

Third, additional tests may not be necessary as the symptoms and diagnosis align well. However, a malaria test could be useful given the patient's fever and location.

Fourth, the patient's high pain scale rating is notable. It may be due to the fever but could also indicate another issue.

Fifth, these symptoms could potentially be signs of a more serious infection. Rule this out by closely monitoring the patient's response to treatment. If symptoms persist or worsen, further intervention may be needed.

Sixth, ask the patient: 
1. "Have you had any other symptoms, like vomiting or diarrhea?" Be attentive to any affirmative answer.
2. "Have you been around anyone who's been sick?" Be attentive to exposure to contagious diseases.
