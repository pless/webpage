First, yes, the treatment plan is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, as personal hygiene and use of mosquito net are preventive measures. However, antimalarial medication should also be included.

Second, the diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the observations. However, the high blood pressure is not typically associated with malaria and should be addressed.

Third, a Malaria test is essential to confirm the diagnosis. A test for Anemia might also be useful, as this can occur in severe cases of malaria.

Fourth, the notably high blood pressure is concerning and needs to be addressed separately, as it's not a usual symptom of malaria.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem like meningitis or encephalitis. To rule out these, observe for neck stiffness, confusion, or seizures. If these are present, refer the patient to a higher-level health facility.

Sixth, ask the patient about recent travel history, exposure to mosquitoes, and if they've taken prophylaxis for malaria. Also, ask about history of high blood pressure. Be attentive to any history of travel to malaria-endemic areas, lack of prophylaxis, or previous episodes of high blood pressure.
