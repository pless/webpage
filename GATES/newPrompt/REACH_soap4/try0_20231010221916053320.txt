1. The treatment is not fully consistent with the diagnosis. The patient should be given anti-malarial drugs for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, not just advice on personal hygiene and use of mosquito net.

2. The diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms and observations.

3. A Malaria test would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis, given the symptoms and the limited tests available.

4. The blood pressure is notably high, which could indicate hypertension. This needs to be addressed.

5. These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like severe malaria or hypertensive crisis. A malaria test can confirm malaria. For hypertension, consistent high readings would confirm it. If confirmed, refer to a higher-level facility.

6. Ask the patient: 
    - Have you had similar symptoms before? If yes, it could suggest recurrent malaria. 
    - Do you often have headaches or feel dizzy? High blood pressure symptoms. 
    - Do you experience chest pain or shortness of breath? These could indicate a hypertensive crisis. Pay attention to 'yes' answers.
