1. The treatment plan is not consistent with the diagnosis. Plasmodium falciparum malaria requires antimalarial medication, not just advice on personal hygiene, water intake, and mosquito net use.

2. The diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms of headache, fever, and feeling hot and cold, which are common in malaria.

3. A malaria test would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis.

4. The patient's extremely high blood pressure (223/75 mmHg) is notable and potentially life-threatening. It needs immediate attention.

5. Yes, these symptoms can be signs of a serious problem. High blood pressure could indicate a hypertensive crisis. Rule out this condition by lowering the blood pressure urgently. If unable to do so, the patient should be referred to a higher-level health facility as soon as possible.

6.  Ask the patient: 
   a) "Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches?" - pay attention to any affirmative answers as these could suggest a hypertensive crisis. 
   b) "Have you taken any antimalarial drugs recently?" - if yes, it could suggest a different diagnosis or drug resistance.
