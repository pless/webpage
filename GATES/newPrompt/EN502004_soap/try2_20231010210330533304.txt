First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of acute tonsillitis. The prescribed amoxicillin is a common antibiotic used for this condition, and paracetamol for pain relief.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the patient's chief complaint of tonsillitis. However, more information on symptoms would provide a clearer picture.

Third, a throat swab culture could be helpful to confirm bacterial tonsillitis, but if not available, the current diagnosis and treatment based on symptoms is acceptable.

Fourth, the patient's BP is within normal range. There's no mention of fever, which is often associated with tonsillitis. 

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like peritonsillar abscess if left untreated. Monitoring for worsening symptoms like difficulty swallowing or breathing is crucial. 

Sixth, ask about the duration and severity of symptoms. Also, ask if she has been around anyone with strep throat or tonsillitis, as it is contagious. Be attentive to any signs of severe pain or difficulty swallowing, as these could indicate a more serious condition.
