1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of acute tonsillitis - lozenges for sore throat, paracetamol for pain and fever, and Amoxicillin as an antibiotic.

2. The diagnosis seems consistent with the chief complaint, but there are no specific observations or physical examination details provided to fully confirm this.

3. Given the limited test options, a complete blood count could help identify anemia or infection if the patient shows additional symptoms. However, it's not explicitly necessary for tonsillitis.

4. Notable is the lack of detailed symptoms or physical examination results. Also, the patient's history of the illness is not provided.

5. These symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem like peritonsillar abscess or mononucleosis. To rule out these, observe for severe throat pain, difficulty swallowing or opening the mouth, or extreme fatigue. If these symptoms are present, refer the patient to a better-equipped facility.

6. Ask the patient if they have had a high fever, difficulty swallowing, or fatigue. Also, inquire about the duration of symptoms. Be attentive to answers indicating symptoms lasting longer than a week, high fever, difficulty swallowing, or extreme fatigue. These could indicate a more serious condition.
