1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Fever and headache are often treated with paracetamol. Artemether/lumefantrine is a standard treatment for malaria, which is common in Nigeria and presents with similar symptoms.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Fever and headache are subjective symptoms reported by the patient. No other objective signs or symptoms are noted.

3. A Malaria test would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis, given the treatment plan includes an anti-malarial drug. A urine analysis could also help rule out other causes of fever such as a urinary tract infection.

4. The patient's high blood pressure is notable. This could be due to the illness or a separate chronic condition.

5. Yes, these symptoms could be a sign of a serious problem like malaria, meningitis, or even hypertension. Malaria can be ruled out with a test. If the patient's high blood pressure persists, further investigation is needed to manage it.

6. Ask the patient if they have had any recent insect bites, which could indicate malaria. Also, ask about any neck stiffness or sensitivity to light, which could suggest meningitis. High blood pressure could indicate a cardiovascular problem, so ask about any history of heart disease or stroke. Be attentive to a positive answer to any of these questions.
