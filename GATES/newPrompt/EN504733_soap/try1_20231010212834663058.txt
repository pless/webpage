1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of fever. Paracetamol is used to reduce fever and Artemether/lumefantrine is an anti-malarial drug, which can be used when malaria is suspected.
2. Yes, the diagnosis of fever is consistent with the symptoms of fever and headache.
3. Considering the symptoms and location, a Malaria test would be useful. If the fever persists after treatment, a Typhoid test could also be considered.
4. The patient's high blood pressure is notable. This could be due to the fever, but if it remains high after the fever subsides, further investigation is necessary.
5. These symptoms could be signs of Malaria, Typhoid or other serious infections. Malaria can be ruled out with a Malaria test. If positive, appropriate treatment should be administered. If negative and symptoms persist, a Typhoid test should be done.
6. Ask the patient if they have been around anyone with similar symptoms, if they have been bitten by mosquitoes, or if they have been in unsanitary conditions. Pay attention to answers that suggest exposure to contagious diseases or unsanitary conditions.
