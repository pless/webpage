First, there's no treatment listed, so consistency with diagnosis cannot be assessed.

Second, the diagnosis isn't mentioned either. The symptoms do indicate gastrointestinal issues, possibly gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

Third, a stool sample analysis would be ideal, but if not possible, a urine analysis could provide useful information. 

Fourth, the patient appears to be mildly dehydrated which is typical with diarrhoea. 

Fifth, these symptoms can be a sign of serious gastrointestinal issues such as cholera or giardiasis. Without specific tests, it's hard to rule them out. If symptoms persist or worsen, refer the patient to a better-equipped facility.

Sixth, ask: 
1) "Have you eaten any new or unusual foods recently?" - pay attention to mentions of undercooked or contaminated food.
2) "Have you been drinking clean water?" - unclean water could indicate waterborne diseases.
3) "Have you been around anyone with similar symptoms?" - could hint at a contagious disease.
