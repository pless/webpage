Without the diagnosis and treatment plan, it's impossible to comment on whether the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, and if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. However, the symptoms presented could suggest a common cold, sinusitis, or allergy. 

Additional tests like Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Urine analysis, Anemia could be helpful only if the patient has other symptoms like fever, body aches, fatigue, etc. 

Without more information, it's hard to comment on whether these symptoms could be a sign of a serious problem. However, if symptoms persist for more than a week or worsen, further investigation might be needed.

Questions to ask could include: 
1. Have you had a fever or body aches? (If yes, consider testing for Malaria or Typhoid)
2. Have you been exposed to any allergens? (If yes, it could be an allergy)
3. Have these symptoms occurred before? (If yes, it could suggest a recurrent issue like sinusitis or allergies)
