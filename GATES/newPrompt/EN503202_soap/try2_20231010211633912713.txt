Without the diagnosis and treatment plan, it's impossible to answer the first and second questions. 

For the third question, a Malaria test could be helpful as headache and running nose can be symptoms. 

For the fourth question, it's notable that the patient's symptoms have been present for a few days. 

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem like Meningitis. A lumbar puncture would be needed to rule this out, but if it's not available, the patient should be referred to a better equipped health facility. 

Sixth, ask: 
1) "Have you had a fever?" - A fever could indicate a more serious condition like Malaria or Meningitis. 
2) "Have you been in contact with anyone with similar symptoms?" - If yes, it could indicate a contagious condition. 
3) "Have you had any changes in vision or consciousness?" - Changes could indicate a serious condition like Meningitis.
