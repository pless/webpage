1) Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of malaria, as PCM (Paracetamol) can be used to manage symptoms such as headache and fever. However, anti-malarial drugs are not mentioned, which are necessary to treat the malaria itself.

2) The diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the observations. The patient has fever, headache, and chills, which are symptoms of malaria. However, the negative malaria parasite (MP) test contradicts the diagnosis.

3) A urine analysis could be helpful to rule out urinary tract infection, which can sometimes present with similar symptoms. 

4) Notable is the recurrence of symptoms related to the patient's PUD, which he reports has returned in the past 2 months, though he does not currently have pain. 

5) Yes, these symptoms can be signs of serious problems like meningitis or encephalitis. To rule these out, ask about neck stiffness, confusion, or changes in consciousness. If these are present, refer the patient for immediate medical attention. 

6) Ask the patient: 
- "Have you been taking any medication for your PUD?" If not, this might be the cause of his bitterness in the mouth.
- "Have you had any recent exposure to anyone with similar symptoms?" This could indicate an infectious cause.
