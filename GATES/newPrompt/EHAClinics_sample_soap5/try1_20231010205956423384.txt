1) Yes, the treatment (Tabs PCM 1g TDS x 3/7) is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. PCM (Paracetamol) is used to manage fever and headache which are symptoms of malaria.

2) Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has headaches, chills, mild fevers, and bitterness of the mouth which are symptoms of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.

3) A test for anemia could be helpful as malaria can cause anemia. H-Pylori test is being done which is important given the patient's history of PUD.

4) The patient has a known drug allergy to chloroquine which is commonly used to treat malaria. This will affect the treatment plan.

5) Yes, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem such as meningitis or a brain tumor. However, these conditions are unlikely given the lack of other symptoms such as neck stiffness or blurry vision. The malaria test has come back negative, so if symptoms persist, other causes should be explored.

6) Ask the patient: 
- Have you noticed any changes in your urine or bowel movements? (Looking for signs of other infections or diseases)
- Have you been in close contact with anyone who is ill? (To determine if the patient could have contracted another infectious disease)
- Have you travelled recently? (To rule out diseases that are common in certain areas)
- Have you been exposed to any unusual substances or environments? (To identify potential causes of the symptoms)
- Have your symptoms improved at all since starting the PCM? (To gauge the effectiveness of the current treatment) 
The answers to look out for would be any significant changes or worsening of symptoms.
