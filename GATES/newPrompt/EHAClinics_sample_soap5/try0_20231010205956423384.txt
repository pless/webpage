1) The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. PCM (paracetamol) is used for symptom relief in malaria. However, specific anti-malarial drugs are not mentioned. 

2) The diagnosis is consistent with the reported symptoms, such as headache, chills, and evening fevers, which are typical of malaria.

3) An anemia test may be helpful as malaria can cause anemia. Also, a urine analysis can be used to check for any related kidney issues. 

4) The patient has a drug allergy to chloroquine, a common anti-malarial drug, this will need to be taken into account when prescribing treatment.

5) These symptoms could indicate a more serious condition such as meningitis or brain tumor. To rule this out, monitor the patient's symptoms and if they worsen or do not improve with treatment, refer them to a hospital for further investigation.

6) Ask the patient about changes in his symptoms, specifically if the headaches have become more severe or frequent. If the answer is yes, it may indicate a more serious condition. Also, ask if the patient has been adhering to the prescribed treatment and if there have been any adverse effects. If the patient is not adhering to the treatment or experiencing adverse effects, alternative treatments may need to be considered.
