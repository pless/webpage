First, the treatment with Buscopan, which is used to relieve cramps in the stomach, is consistent with the complaint of stomachache.

Second, there's no clear diagnosis mentioned, but the prescription of Buscopan suggests a suspicion of gastrointestinal upset or discomfort. 

Third, a urine analysis could be helpful to rule out urinary tract infection, which can sometimes present as abdominal pain. 

Fourth, it is notable that the patient's blood pressure is normal and there's no mention of fever, which could suggest more serious conditions.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem such as appendicitis or an ectopic pregnancy. To rule out appendicitis, ask if the pain is located in the lower right quadrant and if there's any rebound tenderness. For ectopic pregnancy, ask about sexual activity, use of contraception, and any changes in menstrual cycle. If either of these cannot be ruled out, the patient should be referred to a hospital.

Sixth, ask the patient about the exact location of the pain, the nature of the pain (sharp, dull, crampy), any associated symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and any changes in bowel or bladder habits. Pay attention to answers that suggest localized pain, severe pain, or accompanying symptoms which may suggest a more serious condition.
