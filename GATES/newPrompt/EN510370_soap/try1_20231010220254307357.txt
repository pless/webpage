1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Amlodipine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has a history of hypertension and her current blood pressure reading is elevated.

3. No additional tests are necessary at this time. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with their known condition of hypertension.

4. It's important to note that the patient's blood pressure is not well controlled, indicating that the current treatment may not be fully effective. 

5. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to serious problems such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage. To rule out these problems, monitor the patient's symptoms closely and adjust treatment as necessary. If the patient's blood pressure remains high, consider referring her to a larger medical facility for more comprehensive care.

6. Ask the patient: 
   - "Have you been taking your medication regularly?" (Non-adherence to medication could explain the high BP)
   - "Have you noticed any new or worsening symptoms?" (This could indicate complications from hypertension)
   - "Has there been any change in your diet or lifestyle?" (Certain foods, alcohol, and lack of exercise can increase BP)
   - Be attentive to any signs of non-adherence, new symptoms, or unhealthy lifestyle changes.
