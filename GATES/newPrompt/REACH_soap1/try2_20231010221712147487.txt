1. Yes, the treatment of Bisacodyl and encouraging regular water intake is consistent with the diagnosis of constipation.
2. The diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the subjective abdominal pain and lack of appetite, but the lack of other symptoms such as hard stools or infrequent bowel movements makes it less certain.
3. A urine analysis could be helpful to rule out urinary tract infection, which can also cause abdominal pain. 
4. The patient's significant weight loss and fever are notable and not explained by the diagnosis of constipation. These could indicate a more serious underlying condition.
5. Yes, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem such as cancer or an infectious disease. Tests for HIV, Hepatitis, and Anemia could help rule out these conditions. If these tests are positive or the symptoms persist, referral to a higher-level care center is recommended.
6. Questions to ask: 
   - "Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?" (Looking for signs of constipation)
   - "Have you had any recent exposure to potentially contaminated food or water?" (Looking for signs of foodborne illness)
   - "Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss or fever?" (Could indicate a serious underlying condition)
