1. Yes, the treatment of Bisacodyl is consistent with the diagnosis of constipation as it acts as a stimulant laxative.
2. The diagnosis is partially consistent with the observations. Abdominal pain and loss of appetite can be symptoms of constipation, but the patient's fever and abnormal weight loss are not typically associated with constipation. 
3. A urine analysis test could be helpful in ruling out urinary tract infection or kidney stones which can cause abdominal pain. 
4. Noteworthy is the patient's high BMI which could be linked to her abdominal pain if it's caused by a gastrointestinal disorder related to diet. 
5. The symptoms could be a sign of a more serious problem like an infection or malignancy. A urine analysis could help rule out a urinary tract infection. If the symptoms persist after treatment, consider referring the patient to a better-equipped facility.
6. Questions to ask: 
   - "Have you noticed any blood in your stool?" (indicates possible gastrointestinal bleeding)
   - "Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?" (could indicate a more serious gastrointestinal issue)
   - "Have you had any changes in your bowel movements?" (consistency, frequency, color, which can provide more information about possible conditions)
   - "Have you recently traveled or eaten anything unusual?" (could indicate foodborne illness)
   - "Is the pain localized or does it spread?" (can help differentiate between conditions) 
   Be attentive to answers indicating blood in stool, recent travel or unusual food, and changes in bowel movements.
