1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of impetigo as wound dressing and ongoing treatment (likely antibiotics) are standard.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations of a wound with rash, papules, and nodules.
3. No additional tests are needed as the symptoms and observations align with impetigo.
4. It's notable that the patient reports head pain. This could be from the forehead wound or could be a separate issue.
5. If the head pain continues or worsens, it could indicate a more serious problem like a head injury or infection spreading to the brain. Monitor the pain and if it persists or worsens, refer to a higher-level facility.
6. Ask: Is the headache worsening or accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, nausea, or changes in vision? If yes, consider referral. How did you acquire the wound? If it was from a traumatic event, consider potential head injury.
