First, the treatment plan is not explicitly stated, but the diagnosis of Allergic Rhinitis, unspecified, would typically be treated with antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, or decongestants. 

Second, the diagnosis of Allergic Rhinitis is consistent with symptoms of fever, headache, catarrh, and coughing.

Third, an additional test that could be helpful is a Typhoid test, as the symptoms could also be indicative of Typhoid Fever.

Fourth, the patient has a fever and pain, which should be monitored and managed appropriately.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem, such as Typhoid Fever. To rule this out, a Typhoid test should be conducted. If Typhoid cannot be ruled out, the patient should be treated with antibiotics.

Sixth, questions to ask could include: 
1) "Have you been exposed to anyone with a similar illness recently?" - pay attention to any mentions of contact with sick individuals, 
2) "Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?" - attention should be paid to any mention of blood or unusual colors, 
3) "Have you traveled recently?" - pay attention to travel to areas with higher risk of diseases like Typhoid or Malaria.
