1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Allergic rhinitis does not require specific treatment beyond symptom management.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. However, fever is not typical for allergic rhinitis and could indicate an infection.

4. The patient's fever is notable, as this is not typical in allergic rhinitis. 

5. Yes, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem such as meningitis or a systemic infection. A lumbar puncture would be the ideal test to rule out meningitis, but this is not available. If symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should be referred to a hospital.

6. Ask the patient if they have a stiff neck or sensitivity to light (meningitis symptoms). Also ask about any recent weight loss, night sweats, or swollen lymph nodes (HIV symptoms). Be attentive to positive responses.
