First, the treatment is not entirely consistent with the diagnosis. The patient has been prescribed antiallergic eye drops, but there is no clear diagnosis of an allergic reaction.

Second, the diagnosis is not consistent with the observations. The symptoms of smoky vision, oily discharge, eye itching, redness, and foreign body sensation could indicate a more serious issue like glaucoma, corneal ulcer or even dry eye syndrome.

Third, a further physical examination of the eye would be helpful, but given the clinic's resources, it might not be possible. 

Fourth, the patient's high blood pressure is notable and should be addressed.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious eye problem. Without more specialized tests, it's hard to rule out more serious conditions. Referral to an eye specialist, if possible, should be done next.

Sixth, ask the patient if he has any history of eye diseases or surgeries, and if the symptoms are accompanied by pain. Pay attention to answers indicating a history of glaucoma or severe eye pain, which could suggest more serious conditions.
