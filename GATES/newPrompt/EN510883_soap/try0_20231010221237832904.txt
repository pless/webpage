1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Acute Upper Respiratory Infection (URI). Ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and relieve cough.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Symptoms such as fever, cough, and catarrh align with a URI.

3. Considering the limited resources, no additional tests seem necessary at this point. However, if symptoms persist, a malaria test could be re-done.

4. There's a discrepancy between reported eye discharge and normal eye examination. This needs clarification.

5. These symptoms could signify a more serious condition like pneumonia. If the patient's condition worsens (increased fever, cough, difficulty breathing), immediate medical attention is required.

6. Ask if the patient's fever has reduced since starting the antimalarial. Also, inquire about the color and consistency of the eye discharge. Answers indicating persisting high fever or yellow/green eye discharge warrant immediate attention.
