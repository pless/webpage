1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of malaria.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations of fever and headache.
3. Additional tests for Typhoid and Anemia could be helpful as they also present with similar symptoms. 
4. Notable is the patient's IUCD in situ for 2 years and her moderate distress.
5. These symptoms could be a sign of a more serious problem like meningitis or sepsis. We cannot rule this out completely without additional tests and a lumbar puncture, which is not available. If the patient does not improve, referral to a higher-level facility is recommended.
6. Ask the patient if she has any rashes or has noticed any changes in her vision. If she answers yes to either of these questions, it could indicate a more severe condition like meningitis or sepsis. Also, ask about recent travel or exposure to ill individuals; a positive response could suggest a potential infectious source.
