First, the treatment plan and diagnosis are not mentioned, so I can't comment on their consistency.

Second, diarrhea and abdominal pain are consistent with a number of conditions, such as gastroenteritis, food poisoning, or potentially more serious issues like appendicitis. 

Third, a urine analysis could help rule out urinary tract infection. A test for Malaria and Typhoid could help if fever is present. However, without more information, it's hard to say which tests would be most useful.

Fourth, the patient's blood pressure is normal, which is notable given the complaint of abdominal pain.

Fifth, these symptoms could potentially be a sign of a serious problem like appendicitis. The patient should be asked about any fever, vomiting, or if the pain is localized to one area. If appendicitis is suspected, the patient should be referred to a hospital for further investigation.

Sixth, important questions include: 
1) Have you noticed any blood in your stool? (Blood could indicate a more serious gastrointestinal issue)
2) Have you been vomiting? (Vomiting could indicate food poisoning or a more serious gastrointestinal issue)
3) Is your pain localized or general? (Localized pain could indicate appendicitis)
4) Have you been exposed to anyone with similar symptoms? (This could indicate an infectious cause)
5) Have you recently eaten any unusual or potentially contaminated food? (This could indicate food poisoning)
The presence of blood, vomiting, localized pain, exposure to sick individuals, or potential food contamination should all be taken seriously.
