Without the diagnosis and treatment plan, it's impossible to evaluate if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis and vice versa. 

Diarrhea and abdominal pain could suggest a range of conditions, from food poisoning to more serious gastrointestinal diseases. Given the limited resources, a urine analysis could help rule out urinary tract infection which can sometimes present with abdominal pain.

It is notable that the pain is relatively new (1 day). Ask if the patient has any other symptoms like fever, vomiting, or blood in stool. Also, ask about recent food or water intake, and any similar past episodes. Answers indicating severe symptoms or potential contamination could point towards acute conditions like gastroenteritis. 

Diarrhea can be a sign of a serious problem if it persists or is accompanied by other severe symptoms. If these cannot be ruled out, hydration and symptom management should be prioritized while seeking further medical assistance.
