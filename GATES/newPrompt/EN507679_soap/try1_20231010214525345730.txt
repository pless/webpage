First, the treatment plan is not mentioned, so I cannot determine if it is consistent with the diagnosis.

Second, there is no diagnosis stated. Based on the symptoms of insomnia, headache, fever, and upper back pain, it could be malaria, typhoid, or a urinary tract infection. 

Third, further tests such as Typhoid and Urine analysis could be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. 

Fourth, the patient's high blood pressure is notable. This could be a symptom of an underlying condition or due to pain and fever.

Fifth, these symptoms can be signs of a serious problem like malaria or typhoid. To rule out these conditions, typhoid test and urine analysis should be done. If these tests are positive, appropriate treatment should be started immediately.

Sixth, ask the patient if he has any history of similar symptoms or if he has been in contact with anyone suffering from these conditions. Also ask about any recent travel history. If the patient has a history of similar symptoms, it could indicate a chronic condition. If he has been in contact with someone with these symptoms or has travelled to an endemic area, it increases the likelihood of conditions like malaria or typhoid.
