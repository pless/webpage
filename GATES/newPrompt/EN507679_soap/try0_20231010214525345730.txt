1. Treatment: Not provided, cannot assess if consistent with diagnosis.
2. Diagnosis: Not provided, cannot assess if consistent with observations.
3. Other tests: Given the symptoms (insomnia, fever, headache, and upper back pain), a typhoid test may be helpful. 
4. Notable: The patient's high blood pressure is concerning and could be related to the headache. Also, the persistent upper back pain needs further investigation.
5. Serious problem: These symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem like a systemic infection or even a cardiac issue. Rule out infection first with typhoid and malaria tests. If negative, consider cardiac issues due to high blood pressure and back pain.
6. Questions: 
   - Has the patient had any chest pain or shortness of breath? (If yes, could indicate a cardiac issue)
   - Has the patient travelled recently or been exposed to anyone sick? (If yes, could indicate exposure to infectious disease)
   - Has the patient had any changes in vision or balance? (If yes, could indicate neurological issue)
