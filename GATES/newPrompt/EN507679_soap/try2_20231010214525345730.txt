First, the treatment plan is not provided, so it's impossible to tell if it's consistent with the diagnosis.

Second, the diagnosis is also not provided, but the subjective symptoms of insomnia, headache, and fever could suggest malaria, especially in a region where it's common like Nigeria. The positive Malaria Parasite - RDT supports this.

Third, a typhoid test could be useful, as symptoms can overlap with malaria. An anemia test could also be considered since chronic disease can lead to anemia. 

Fourth, the patient's high blood pressure is notable and should be addressed. 

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem, like cerebral malaria or meningitis. A lumbar puncture would be needed to rule these out, which might not be feasible in this setting. If these can't be ruled out, the patient should be referred to a hospital for further care.

Sixth, ask the patient if he's had any stiff neck or sensitivity to light, which could indicate meningitis. Also ask if the headaches have been getting progressively worse, which could indicate a more serious condition. Be attentive to "yes" answers to these questions.
