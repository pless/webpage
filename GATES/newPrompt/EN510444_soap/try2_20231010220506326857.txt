1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Ibuprofen can help to reduce inflammation and pain in the case of acute serous otitis media.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has ear pain, a runny nose, and a cough, which are symptoms of otitis media. The physical examination also reveals fluid in the right ear.

3. Additional tests might not be necessary at this stage. Otitis media is primarily diagnosed based on symptoms and physical examination. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, a urine analysis could be helpful to rule out a possible bacterial infection.

4. Notable is the absence of fever, which is often seen in acute otitis media. This may suggest a viral infection or a less severe case.

5. If untreated, otitis media can lead to more serious complications such as mastoiditis or meningitis. Monitoring the patient's symptoms and response to treatment is crucial. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear (like high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness), immediate medical attention is needed.

6. Questions to ask: 
a) Has the child had previous episodes of ear infections? (Recurrent ear infections can increase the risk of complications)
b) Are there any other symptoms, like dizziness or balance problems? (This could indicate a more serious problem like labyrinthitis)
c) Has the child been exposed to second-hand smoke or does he attend daycare? (These are risk factors for otitis media) 
Watch for positive answers to these questions.
