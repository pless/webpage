1. Yes, the treatment of ibuprofen is consistent with acute serous otitis media, which is typically treated with pain relief.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations of ear pain, discharge and presence of fluid in the right tympanic membrane.
3. No other physical examples or additional tests would be helpful in this case.
4. Notable is the lack of fever and good general health despite the ear infection.
5. In most cases, acute serous otitis media is not a serious problem. However, an untreated ear infection can potentially lead to complications like mastoiditis or meningitis. The absence of fever and the child's overall good health make these unlikely. If symptoms worsen or persist beyond the 5-day treatment, further examination may be necessary.
6. Ask: "Has the child recently suffered from a cold or a respiratory infection?" If yes, this could confirm the diagnosis. Also ask: "Has the child been exposed to smoke or other irritants?" If yes, this could have contributed to the infection.
