First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Acute serous otitis media (ASOM). Ibuprofen is prescribed for pain relief and anti-inflammatory effect.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Symptoms of ear pain, pulling of the ear, and scanty discharge from the right ear align with ASOM. 

Third, no additional tests would be necessary at this point. The symptoms and physical exam provide enough evidence for the diagnosis.

Fourth, the child's general appearance is stable, and he's well-appearing and comfortable despite the ear pain. That's a good sign.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem like a severe ear infection or mastoiditis. Symptoms to watch for include severe pain, high fever, and swelling behind the ear. If these occur, the child should be seen immediately.

Sixth, ask the mother if the child has had any high fevers, severe pain, or swelling behind the ear. If the answer is yes to any of these, it could indicate a more serious condition. Also, ask if the child's symptoms improve on medication. If not, the child may need a different treatment approach.
