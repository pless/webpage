1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Antazoline is an antihistamine used to alleviate eye allergies and cetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations of red, itchy eyes.

3. The provided tests are not necessary for this diagnosis. Allergic conjunctivitis is typically diagnosed based on patient history and symptoms.

4. Notable is that the symptoms have been persistent for two months, which is quite long for allergic conjicuntivitis.

5. Persistent red, itchy eyes could potentially indicate a more serious problem such as an eye infection or a foreign body in the eye. However, these are less likely given the patient's symptoms. 

6. Ask the patient if there is any discharge from the eyes (pay attention to yellow or green discharge which could indicate infection), ask if there is any pain in the eyes (pain could suggest a foreign body or infection), and ask about any changes in vision (blurry vision could indicate a more serious eye condition).
