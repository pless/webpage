1. The treatment of IV Ceftriaxone and Paracetamol is consistent with the diagnosis of UTI and fever management.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations of fever, flank pain, and supra pubic pain. However, the negative MP test contradicts the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
3. A retest for Malaria might be helpful, given the symptoms and location. A typhoid test could also be considered due to overlapping symptoms.
4. The patient's hypertensive history is notable. Also, the patient is allergic to penicillin.
5. These symptoms could be a sign of a kidney infection or pelvic inflammatory disease. A Urine analysis can help rule out kidney issues. Unfortunately, ruling out PID would typically require an ultrasound which is unavailable.
6. Questions: 
   a) Have you noticed any changes in the color, smell, or frequency of your urine? If yes, it might indicate UTI.
   b) Have you experienced any vaginal discharge or discomfort? If yes, it could suggest PID. 
   c) Have you been exposed to anyone with malaria or been in an area with high mosquito activity recently? If yes, it might indicate possible malaria exposure despite the negative test.
