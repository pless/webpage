First, the treatment plan is not listed, so it can't be determined if it is consistent with the diagnosis.

Second, the diagnosis is not listed, but the patient's symptoms of fever and headache are consistent with several conditions, including malaria, which was tested for.

Third, a test for typhoid could be helpful given the fever symptom and the location in Nigeria where typhoid is common. 

Fourth, the patient's blood pressure is normal, but it's notable that she's experiencing a headache along with her fever.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like meningitis. A spinal tap would be needed to diagnose this, but it's not available at your clinic. If the patient's condition doesn't improve or worsens, she should be referred to a hospital for further evaluation.

Sixth, ask the patient if she has any neck stiffness or sensitivity to light, as these could be signs of meningitis. Also, ask if she's noticed any rashes, which could indicate typhoid fever. Be attentive to positive responses to these questions.
