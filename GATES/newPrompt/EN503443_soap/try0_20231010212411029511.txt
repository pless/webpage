The information provided is incomplete to make a comprehensive review. However, based on the available data:

First, the treatment is not mentioned, so I cannot evaluate its consistency with the diagnosis.

Second, peptic ulcers typically present with abdominal pain, not chest pain. Therefore, the diagnosis might not be consistent with the observations.

Third, a urine analysis could be helpful to rule out urinary tract infection which can sometimes present with abdominal discomfort. 

Fourth, the note lacks important information such as the patient's symptoms in detail, her medical history, the diagnosis, and the treatment plan.

Fifth, chest pain can be a sign of a serious problem like heart disease. Ask the patient about the nature of the chest pain, its duration, and any associated symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, or nausea. If these symptoms are present, referral to a better-equipped facility is necessary.

Sixth, ask the patient: 1) "Can you describe the chest pain?" - Be attentive to descriptions of crushing, pressure-like pain, which may suggest heart disease. 2) "Is the pain related to meals?" - Pain related to meals could be a sign of peptic ulcer disease. 3) "Have you noticed any blood in your stool?" - This may suggest bleeding peptic ulcer. 4) "Do you have any history of heart disease?" - A positive answer increases the likelihood of the chest pain being heart-related.
