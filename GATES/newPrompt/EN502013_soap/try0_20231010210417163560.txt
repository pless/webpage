First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat peptic ulcers.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has a history of peptic ulcers and is complaining of chest pain, a common symptom of ulcers.

Third, a urine analysis could be helpful to rule out a urinary tract infection, which can sometimes present with abdominal pain. Anemia test could also be beneficial as peptic ulcers can sometimes cause slow blood loss leading to anemia.

Fourth, the patient's blood pressure is slightly on the lower side. This could be due to many factors including the peptic ulcers.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem such as heart disease, especially in a woman of this age. To rule this out, ask the patient about the nature of the chest pain - is it sharp, does it radiate anywhere, does it get worse with exertion, etc. If it seems heart related, she should be referred to a hospital for further investigation.

Sixth, questions: 
1) Can you describe the chest pain? (Sharp, stabbing pains could indicate a heart problem, while a burning pain could be consistent with ulcers)
2) Do you notice any blood in your stool? (This could indicate a bleeding ulcer)
3) Do you have any shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting? (These could be signs of heart disease or anemia from a bleeding ulcer)
