First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of essential hypertension. Amlodipine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's blood pressure is elevated.

Third, a urine analysis could be helpful to rule out kidney issues which can cause hypertension.

Fourth, the patient's headache and dizziness could be symptoms of the hypertension, but these are also common symptoms for many conditions. 

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem like a stroke. The only way to rule this out would be imaging such as a CT scan, which isn't available. If the patient's symptoms worsen or don't improve, they should seek care at a facility with more resources.

Sixth, ask the patient if they have a history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, and if the headache and dizziness came on suddenly or gradually. Sudden onset could indicate a more serious problem like a stroke. Also ask if they've noticed any changes in vision or difficulty speaking or moving, which could also indicate a stroke.
