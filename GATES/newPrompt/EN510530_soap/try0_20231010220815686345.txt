1. Yes, the treatment of Amlodipine is consistent with the diagnosis of Essential Hypertension. 
2. The diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the observations - the elevated blood pressure supports the diagnosis. However, other symptoms like headache and dizziness could be signs of another underlying condition.
3. Additional tests such as Malaria, Typhoid, and Anemia could be helpful, as these could potentially cause headaches and dizziness.
4. Notable is the age of the patient and acutely ill appearance, suggesting that the condition might be serious.
5. Yes, these symptoms can be signs of a serious problem like stroke or heart disease. Anemia or infection tests could help rule out these conditions. If not, monitoring the patient's blood pressure and adjusting medication as needed should be done.
6. Ask the patient if they have had similar symptoms before and if they have a history of heart disease or stroke. Pay attention to affirmative answers, as these could suggest a more serious condition. Also ask about any recent changes in vision or balance, as these could indicate a neurological issue.
