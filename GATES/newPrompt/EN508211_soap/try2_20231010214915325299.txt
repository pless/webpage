1. The treatment of pain management with Co-Codamol and Vitamin C is consistent with the diagnosis of chronic knee pain, potentially due to arthritis.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has been suffering from knee pain for more than 5 years, with no history of trauma or sudden fall. 
3. An X-ray of the knee would be helpful if pain persists to confirm arthritis. Unfortunately, the limited resources at the clinic might not allow this. A uric acid test could help rule out gout.
4. Notable is the patient's hypertension and the ocular pain post-surgery. These issues should also be addressed.
5. Chronic knee pain could be a sign of a serious problem like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. An X-ray would help rule this out, but if unavailable, monitoring the patient's response to pain management might be the next best step.
6. Ask about the nature of the knee pain (sharp, dull, constant, intermittent), if there's any swelling or redness, and if the patient has tried any treatments in the past. Pay attention to worsening symptoms or lack of improvement with current treatment.
