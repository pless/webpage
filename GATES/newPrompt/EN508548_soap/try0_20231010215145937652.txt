1. No diagnosis is given, so it's unclear if the treatment is consistent with a diagnosis. 
2. Again, no diagnosis is provided, so it's unclear if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. 
3. A urine analysis may be helpful as it can assist in diagnosing a urinary tract infection, which can cause generalized discomfort. 
4. The patient's blood pressure is high, which could indicate hypertension. This may be why the patient is prescribed Norvasc and Accord. 
5. Headaches and general body pain could be a sign of a serious problem such as meningitis or a severe infection. This would be difficult to rule out without further tests. 
6. Ask the patient if the headache is localized or diffuse, and if they have any associated symptoms such as fever, neck stiffness, or light sensitivity. Also, ask about any history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Be attentive to answers indicating severe, sudden headache onset or associated signs of meningitis, and any history of chronic hypertension.
