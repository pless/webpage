Without the complete information, it's impossible to answer these questions accurately. However, based on the information provided:

1. The treatment plan is not mentioned, so it's not possible to determine if it's consistent with the diagnosis.
2. The diagnosis is also not mentioned, so it's impossible to determine if it's consistent with the observations.
3. Additional tests that could be helpful include Malaria, Typhoid and Anemia tests due to the patient's symptoms of general body pain and fever. 
4. The notable thing is the lack of detail in this report. Important information such as medical history, current medication, and vital signs are missing.
5. These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like Malaria, Typhoid or some other infectious diseases. We could rule these out by conducting the available tests. If we cannot rule this out, the patient should be referred to a better-equipped facility.
