Second: The diagnosis of hypertension is consistent with the patient's history and current blood pressure readings.

Third: A urine analysis could be useful to check for kidney damage from hypertension. 

Fourth: The patient has epigastric pain, which is not addressed in the treatment plan. 

Fifth: The epigastric pain could be a sign of a more serious problem such as a heart condition or gastrointestinal issue. A history of chest pain should be taken seriously. If resources allow, the patient should be referred to a facility that can perform an ECG or ultrasound.

Sixth: Ask the patient if the pain radiates to the back or if it's associated with meals. Also, ask if there's any history of heart disease in the family. Pay attention to "yes" answers, which could indicate a serious condition.
