1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Malaria, as ACT (Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy) is the recommended treatment for Malaria.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, and body weakness, along with a positive RDT for Malaria, align with a Malaria diagnosis.
