1. The treatment of Nifedipine is consistent with the diagnosis of hypertension, as evident by the high blood pressure. The paracetamol is consistent with the chief complaint of headache.

2. The diagnosis of hypertension is consistent with the observed blood pressure of 145/90 mm[Hg]. 

3. Anemia test could be helpful to rule out any blood-related issues which could sometimes present with fatigue and headaches. 

4. It's notable that there's no differential diagnosis provided. Also, the patient's headache has been persistent for 5 days, which could be a symptom of a more serious issue.

5. Persistent headaches could be a sign of serious problems such as brain tumors, aneurysms, or brain infections. However, in this setting, it's difficult to rule out these problems due to the lack of diagnostic resources. If the headache persists or worsens after the treatment, the patient should be referred to a hospital with more resources.

6. Ask the patient: 
- If the headache is localized or generalized? (Localized headaches might indicate a more serious issue)
- If there are any other symptoms like fever, nausea, or vision changes? (Symptoms like high fever or vision changes might indicate a more serious issue like meningitis or a brain tumor) 
- If there's a history of similar headaches or hypertension in the family? (A positive family history could indicate a genetic predisposition for these conditions)
