1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Nifedipine is used for managing hypertension, which the patient appears to have with a BP of 145/90, and Paracetamol is prescribed for the headache.

2. The diagnosis appears consistent with the observations - the patient's high blood pressure and headache suggest hypertension.

3. A urine analysis could be helpful to rule out kidney issues or pregnancy, both of which could be causing the elevated blood pressure.

4. It's notable that no differential diagnosis is listed. High blood pressure could also be a symptom of preeclampsia in a pregnant woman, or kidney disease.

5. These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like chronic hypertension, kidney disease, or preeclampsia in pregnancy. A urine analysis could help rule out kidney disease and pregnancy. If these can't be ruled out, the patient should be referred to a hospital for further tests.

6. Ask the patient if she has experienced any recent weight gain, swelling, or changes in vision. Also ask if there's a chance she could be pregnant. Pay attention to positive answers, as these could suggest preeclampsia or kidney disease.
