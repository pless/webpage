1. The treatment is somewhat consistent with the diagnosis of a cough, but lacking antibiotic therapy if bacterial infection is suspected.

2. The diagnosis is consistent with the presented symptoms, but it's quite general. With fever present, a more specific diagnosis could be sought.

3. A Malaria or Typhoid test could be useful given the fever and location (Nigeria). 

4. Notable is that the patient's blood pressure is normal, which is a good sign. However, duration and severity of fever and cough are not mentioned.

5. These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like pneumonia, TB, or a severe infection. Tests for Malaria and Typhoid could help rule out these conditions. If tests are positive, appropriate treatments should be initiated.

6. Ask: 
   - "Do you have any chest pain or difficulty breathing?" (Signs of pneumonia)
   - "Have you noticed any night sweats?" (Sign of TB)
   - "Have you been in contact with anyone sick?" (Could indicate contagious disease)
   - "Have you traveled recently?" (Could indicate exposure to different pathogens)
   
   Pay attention to affirmative answers, which would suggest a more serious problem.
