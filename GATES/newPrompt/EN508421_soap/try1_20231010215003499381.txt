1. The treatment is not entirely consistent with the diagnosis. The prescribed medications do deal with the symptoms (cough and fever) but do not address the underlying cause.

2. The diagnosis of a simple 'Cough' is not consistent with the observations. A cough and fever for three days could signify a number of conditions, such as pneumonia or a respiratory infection.

3. The clinic should conduct a Malaria and Typhoid test, as both can present with these symptoms. A urine analysis might also be helpful to rule out a urinary tract infection.

4. It's notable that there's no mention of any differential diagnoses. 

5. These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like pneumonia, TB, or even HIV. Tests for Malaria and Typhoid can help rule out these conditions. If these tests come back negative, the patient should be referred to a facility with more resources.

6. Ask the patient: 
- If the cough is accompanied by chest pain or difficulty breathing (signs of pneumonia or other serious conditions). 
- If there's a history of similar symptoms or known exposure to TB or HIV. 
- If there's been any recent travel or exposure to someone with similar symptoms (could indicate a contagious disease). 
Pay attention to 'yes' answers to these questions.
