1. The treatment is partially consistent with the diagnosis. The cough syrup and paracetamol are appropriate for cough and fever. However, there's no treatment for the underlying cause of the cough and fever.

2. The diagnosis of "cough" is not consistent with the observations. Cough is a symptom, not a diagnosis. The fever suggests some sort of infection, which hasn't been diagnosed.

3. The Malaria and Typhoid tests would be useful given the symptoms of cough and fever. A urine analysis could also be beneficial to rule out urinary tract infections.

4. Notable is the absence of a complete differential diagnosis. The patient's symptoms could indicate a variety of conditions, from a simple upper respiratory infection to more serious diseases like tuberculosis or pneumonia.

5. These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like TB, pneumonia, or a severe bacterial infection. To rule out these, a chest x-ray would be ideal, but isn't available. Therefore, close monitoring of the patient and referral to a higher level facility if symptoms worsen is recommended.

6. Important questions include: 
- "Have you had contact with anyone sick recently?" Pay attention for any contact with TB or pneumonia patients.
- "Have you travelled recently?" Look for travel to malaria-endemic areas.
- "Are you experiencing any chest pain or difficulty in breathing?" These could indicate a more serious condition like pneumonia.
