Third, a blood pressure test was done, but given the symptoms, tests for Malaria, Typhoid, and Anemia could be helpful. 

Fourth, the patient has high blood pressure that needs immediate attention. 

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like hypertension or a brain-related issue. Hypertension can be ruled out by managing the blood pressure. A brain-related issue can't be ruled out in the clinic due to limited resources. The patient should be referred to a hospital for further examination. 

Sixth, ask the patient if they've had similar symptoms in the past and if there's a history of hypertension in their family. Pay attention if they answer 'yes' to either question. Also, ask if the headache is associated with nausea or vomiting. If 'yes', this could indicate a more serious condition like meningitis or a brain tumor.
