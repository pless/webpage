1) Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of acute nasopharyngitis. Celecoxib for pain and inflammation, Loratadine for allergy symptoms, Beehive syrup for cough, and Vitamin C for immune support are appropriate.

2) Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms of global headache, runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, dry cough, and chest pain.

3) Anemia test could be helpful considering the patient's age and symptoms, which may indicate iron deficiency anemia. Additionally, a Malaria test could be considered due to the regional prevalence.

4) Notable is the patient's history of Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) and only taking Panadol. This could be important in managing her symptoms and possible drug interactions.

5) These symptoms could be a sign of a more serious problem like pneumonia or tuberculosis. Chest X-ray can help rule this out but if not available, monitoring symptom progression is key. If symptoms worsen, refer to a larger facility.

6) Ask the patient if her cough has worsened, or if she has experienced any shortness of breath or fever. If yes to any, it may indicate a more serious condition like pneumonia. Also, ask about any changes in bowel habits due to PUD. If any drastic changes, it could indicate a worsening of PUD.
