1. No treatment or diagnosis provided in the note, so it's impossible to determine if they're consistent.

2. No diagnosis is provided but the symptoms described (headache and epigastric pain) could suggest a range of conditions, from simple stress or gastric upset, to more serious conditions like malaria.

3. Tests for Malaria could be helpful considering the region and symptoms. Also, a urine analysis could help rule out a urinary tract infection which might cause abdominal pain.

4. Notable is the lack of information on the differential diagnosis and treatment plan. Also, there is no information about the patient's fever, which is crucial in this scenario.

5. Yes, these symptoms could indicate a serious problem such as Meningitis or Malaria. Testing for Malaria could help rule this out. If positive, treatment should begin immediately.

6. Ask: 
   - "Have you had any fever or chills?" (Pay attention to any affirmative answer)
   - "Have you noticed any changes in your vision?" (Deterioration might suggest increased intracranial pressure)
   - "Have you been around anyone who is sick?" (Exposure to infectious diseases)
   - "Have you had any nausea or vomiting?" (Could indicate more serious gastrointestinal or neurological issues)
   - "Have you had any recent travel history?" (Possible exposure to different pathogens)
