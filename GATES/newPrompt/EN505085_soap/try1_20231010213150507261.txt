Without information on the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment plan, I can't assess whether the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis or whether the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. 

However, considering the symptoms of headache and epigastric pain, Malaria or Typhoid tests could be helpful, as these diseases are prevalent in Nigeria and could present with these symptoms. 

It's notable that the patient is a young female with epigastric pain. This could potentially indicate a gynecological issue, or even early pregnancy, which the clinic may not have the resources to investigate. 

These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like meningitis or a brain tumor, which would be difficult to rule out in this setting. If the symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should be referred to a hospital for further investigation. 

Questions to ask could include: 
1) Have you had any fever, vomiting, or changes in vision? (These could indicate malaria, typhoid, or a neurological problem)
2) Have you had any changes in your menstrual cycle? (This could help rule in/out a gynecological issue or pregnancy)
3) Have you been exposed to anyone with similar symptoms or known diseases like malaria or typhoid? (This could indicate a communicable disease). 
Pay attention to the answers that suggest systemic illness or gynecologic issues.
