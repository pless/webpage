First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, focusing on prevention.

Second, the diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the observations. Fever is a common symptom of malaria, but body weakness and headache can be symptoms of many conditions.

Third, a Malaria test would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis. Anemia test could also be useful as malaria can cause anemia.

Fourth, it's notable that there's no information on the patient's medication, allergies, vaccination, and family history. These could be crucial for diagnosis and treatment.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like HIV or Hepatitis. HIV test and Hepatitis test could help rule out these conditions. If these cannot be ruled out, the patient should be referred to a facility that can provide further testing and treatment.

Sixth, questions to ask: 
1) Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements or urination? (Look for signs of dehydration or kidney issues)
2) Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss? (This could indicate a chronic condition)
3) Have you had any recent insect bites, particularly mosquito bites? (As this can lead to malaria)
4) Have you been vaccinated against diseases like Hepatitis? (This could help rule out certain conditions) 

Pay attention to any affirmative answers.
