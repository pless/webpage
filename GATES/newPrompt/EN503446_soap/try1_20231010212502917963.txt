Fourth, it's notable that the patient has acute perforation. This is a serious condition requiring immediate attention.

Fifth, these symptoms can be signs of a more serious problem like gastrointestinal bleeding or infection. The patient should be monitored closely. If pain persists or worsens, immediate referral to a higher-level facility should be considered.

Sixth, questions to ask: 
1. Are you experiencing any other symptoms such as vomiting, blood in stool, or weight loss? (Pay attention to 'yes' answers, these can indicate a more serious condition)
2. Does the chest pain worsen with physical activity? (If 'yes', this could indicate a heart-related issue)
3. Have you been taking any over-the-counter medicines like NSAIDs? (Long-term use of these can cause peptic ulcers)
