1. Yes, the treatment (surgery) is consistent with the diagnosis of senile cataract.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the patient's visual difficulties and history of cataract surgery.
3. No additional tests would be helpful as the symptoms and history clearly point to a cataract.
4. Notable is the patient's high blood pressure and low BMI, which indicate possible hypertension and malnutrition.

   - "Have you experienced any headaches or eye pain?" If yes, could indicate glaucoma.
