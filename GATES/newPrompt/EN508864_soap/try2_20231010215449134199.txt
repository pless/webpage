First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Cataract surgery is a common treatment for senile cataract.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has a history of cataract surgery and is currently experiencing difficulties in seeing.

Third, no other physical exams or tests would be helpful in this case. The diagnosis is clear based on the patient’s symptoms and history.

Fourth, the patient's blood pressure is notably high. This could be a sign of hypertension, which should be addressed.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem such as glaucoma. The patient should be asked about any eye pain or redness, which could indicate glaucoma. If glaucoma cannot be ruled out, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further examination.

Sixth, ask the patient if they have been experiencing any additional symptoms such as eye pain, redness, or headaches. If they answer yes to any of these, it could indicate a more serious condition such as glaucoma. Also ask about their adherence to any post-surgery care or medication regimen they were given after their previous cataract surgery. Non-adherence could potentially explain their current symptoms.
