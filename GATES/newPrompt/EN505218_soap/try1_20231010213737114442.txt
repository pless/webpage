First, no treatment or diagnosis provided, so I can't comment on consistency.

Second, the diagnosis isn't stated, so it's impossible to determine its consistency with the symptoms.

Third, a Malaria test might be helpful given the symptom of headache and the location of the clinic. 

Fourth, the patient has a low blood pressure which may be related to the symptoms.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious infection or disease. Malaria test should be conducted to rule out this condition. 

Sixth, ask the patient if they've had any fever or chills, which could indicate Malaria. Also, ask if they've been in contact with anyone ill recently. If the answer to either is yes, it could indicate a more serious condition.
