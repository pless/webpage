First, there's no treatment plan mentioned, so it's impossible to judge if it's consistent with the diagnosis. 

Second, the diagnosis is not given. 

Third, a malaria test could be helpful given the symptoms and location. 

Fourth, the blood pressure is slightly low, but not dangerously so. 

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem such as meningitis. A lumbar puncture would help rule this out, but if it's not available, the patient should be monitored closely for worsened symptoms. 

Sixth, I would ask:
1) "Have you had any fever?" - Fever could indicate a serious infection.
2) "Have you had any neck stiffness?" - Neck stiffness could indicate meningitis.
3) "Have you been around anyone with similar symptoms?" - This could indicate a contagious disease.
