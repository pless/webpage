1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of impetigo. Topical antibiotics, wound cleaning, and pain relief are standard.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms and observations. Impetigo typically presents as pustules that burst and scab over.
3. No additional test seems necessary based on the symptoms and diagnosis. 
4. It is notable that the patient used traditional medicine. Possible reactions or interactions should be monitored.
5. Impetigo can lead to complications like cellulitis, MRSA, or kidney inflammation. To rule out, monitor symptoms closely, and escalate treatment if needed.
6. Ask if the patient has allergies, especially to antibiotics, as this affects treatment. Also, ask about the exact traditional substances used on the wound - some may interfere with healing or cause reactions. Be attentive to any history of severe reactions or specific substances used.
