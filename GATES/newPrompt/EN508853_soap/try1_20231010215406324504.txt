First, the treatment of Nurofen for body pain is consistent with the complaint.

Second, there is no clear diagnosis provided in this note, only a complaint of body pain.

Third, additional tests like Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, and Urine analysis could be helpful to rule out infection or disease causing the body pain. 

Fourth, the note lacks crucial details about the patient's symptoms, history, and a clear diagnosis.

Fifth, body pain can be a symptom of serious problems like systemic infection, cancer, or autoimmune disease. More detailed history, symptom description, and further tests should be conducted to rule out these serious conditions.

Sixth, ask the patient: 1) Can you describe the nature of the pain (sharp, dull, constant, intermittent)? Be attentive to constant and severe pain. 2) Have you experienced any other symptoms (fever, weight loss, fatigue)? Be attentive to yes answers for these, as they may indicate a serious condition. 3) Have you had this type of pain before? If yes, it may indicate a chronic condition.
