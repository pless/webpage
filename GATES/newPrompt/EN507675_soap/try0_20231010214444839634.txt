First, there is no treatment or diagnosis listed in this note so I cannot comment on their consistency.

Second, the diagnosis is not consistent with the observations as no diagnosis is provided.

Third, a throat swab for bacterial culture would be ideal, but since it's not available, you may consider a typhoid test if the patient develops fever.

Fourth, the patient's blood pressure is normal, which is notable.

Fifth, these symptoms could indicate a bacterial infection or viral illness, such as the common cold or flu. If symptoms worsen or persist, the patient should seek further medical care. 

Sixth, ask the patient: "Have you had any fever or chills?" If yes, this could indicate a bacterial infection. "Have you been around anyone who is sick?" If yes, this could suggest a contagious illness. "Is there any difficulty swallowing or breathing?" If yes, this could indicate a more severe throat infection.
