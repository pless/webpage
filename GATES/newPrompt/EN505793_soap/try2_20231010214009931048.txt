First, the treatment with Dolo-Meta B is consistent with the diagnosis of lower back pain as it is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to relieve pain.

Second, the diagnosis of lower back pain is consistent with the patient's complaint but additional objective observations might be needed to rule out other conditions.

Third, a urine analysis could be helpful to rule out any kidney issues which can manifest as lower back pain. 

Fourth, there seems to be a typographical error in the subjective part of the notes as the patient's complaint is written as "Law back pain" instead of "Low back pain".

Fifth, these symptoms could indicate a serious problem like kidney infection or kidney stones, which can be ruled out by a urine analysis. If results are abnormal, the patient should be referred to a hospital for further evaluation.

Sixth, ask the patient if the pain radiates anywhere, if there are any urinary symptoms, and if there is any history of trauma or injury to the back. Be attentive to any symptoms indicating kidney issues or severe trauma.
