1. Yes, the treatment (pain relief and antispasmodic) is consistent with the diagnosis of unspecified abdominal pain.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the patient's chief complaint of abdominal pain.

3. A urine analysis could be helpful to rule out urinary tract infection, which can present with abdominal pain.

4. The patient's lack of fever, vomiting, or loose stools is notable as it may rule out certain conditions like appendicitis, gastroenteritis, or UTI. 

5. Yes, abdominal pain could be a sign of a serious problem like appendicitis or intestinal obstruction. A physical exam focusing on rebound tenderness, guarding, or rigidity could help rule out these conditions. If these signs are present, referral to a higher-level facility for possible surgical intervention may be necessary.

6. Questions to ask: (1) Has the patient noticed any blood in her stool? (Be attentive to a 'yes' answer, which could suggest a more serious condition like a gastrointestinal bleed.) (2) Has the pain moved from the belly button to the right lower quadrant? (A 'yes' answer could suggest appendicitis.)
