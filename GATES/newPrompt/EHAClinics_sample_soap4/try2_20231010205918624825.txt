1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The use of paracetamol (PCM) and Hyoscine is suitable for abdominal pain management.

2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's primary symptom is abdominal pain without other specific symptoms like fever, vomiting, or loose stools.

3. A urine analysis might be helpful to rule out urinary tract infection, which can present as abdominal pain. 

4. Notable is the lack of details in the physical examination and the absence of vital signs. 

5. These symptoms can be signs of appendicitis, which can be a serious problem. Asking about the localization of the pain, whether it migrates, and if the patient has experienced loss of appetite could help rule out appendicitis. 

6. Ask the patient if the pain moves from the belly button area to the lower right side and if there is a loss of appetite. Pay attention to a 'Yes' answer for these questions as they can indicate appendicitis. Also ask about changes in urination, such as pain or frequency, which could indicate a urinary tract infection.
