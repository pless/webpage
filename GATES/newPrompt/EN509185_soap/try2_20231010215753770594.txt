First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The redness is due to irritation from cement dust and the Antellarge eye drops are appropriate for treating this.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient presented with red eye following cement particle exposure, which is consistent with the presenting symptoms and history.

Third, no additional tests seem necessary given the patient's symptoms and the limited resources of the clinic. 

Fourth, it's notable that the patient's BMI is quite low (15.2 kg/m2), which could indicate malnutrition or another underlying health issue.

Fifth, these symptoms could potentially be a sign of a more serious problem such as a corneal abrasion. However, without advanced testing equipment, it's difficult to rule this out completely. If the redness doesn't resolve with continued treatment, it may be necessary to refer the patient to a facility with more resources.

Sixth, to rule out acute conditions, ask the patient if they've had any changes in vision, pain in the eye, or discharge from the eye. Also ask if they've had any similar incidents in the past. Be attentive to any positive responses, as these could indicate a more serious problem.
