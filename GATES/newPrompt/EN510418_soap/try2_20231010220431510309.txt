1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. 
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms of fever and headache.
3. A Typhoid test may be useful as symptoms can overlap with malaria. 
4. The blood pressure measurement is missing. 
5. These symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem such as meningitis. A lumbar puncture would be ideal to rule it out, but if not available, monitor for symptoms like stiff neck or light sensitivity. 
6. Ask about any recent travel or exposure to unclean water (Typhoid risk). Also, ask if there's a history of similar symptoms. Watch for answers indicating exposure to contaminated water or repeated episodes of similar symptoms.
