First, the treatment of symptomatic relief with Diclofenac and the counsel to quit smoking is consistent with the diagnosis of unspecified symptoms involving the nervous and musculoskeletal systems.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the subjective and objective observations. The patient's pain seems to be musculoskeletal, possibly related to sleeping on a hard surface and aggravated by deep breathing.

Third, a urine analysis could be useful to rule out kidney issues which can sometimes present as side chest pain. Additionally, HIV and Hepatitis tests could be beneficial given the patient's history of smoking.

Fourth, the patient's low BMI (18.7 kg/m2) is notable as it indicates underweight. This could be related to poor nutrition or other underlying conditions.

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem such as lung cancer, especially given the patient's long-term smoking history. To rule out this problem, refer the patient to a larger hospital for a chest X-ray or CT scan. If this isn't possible, monitor the patient closely for any changes in symptoms.

Sixth, ask the patient: 
1) "Has there been any change in your smoking habits?"- be attentive to an increase in smoking frequency or quantity.
2) "Have you noticed any weight loss?"- unexplained weight loss can be a sign of serious conditions like cancer.
3) "Have you noticed any blood when you cough?"- blood in cough can be a sign of lung conditions including cancer.
4) "Have you experienced any recent fevers or night sweats?"- these could indicate an infection or malignancy.
