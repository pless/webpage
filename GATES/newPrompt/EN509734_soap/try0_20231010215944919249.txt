1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient is experiencing musculoskeletal pain, and Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat this type of pain.

2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's pain is localized, acute, and is aggravated by deep breathing, all of which are indicative of a musculoskeletal issue.

3. A Chest X-ray would be helpful, but it's not available. The patient's symptoms don't suggest Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, or anemia, and a urine analysis doesn't seem necessary.

4. The patient has a history of smoking, which could contribute to chest pain. It's good that the doctor advised him to quit.

5. Yes, chest pain could be a sign of a serious problem like heart disease. However, the patient's age, the nature of his pain, and the absence of other symptoms lower that likelihood. If the pain persists or worsens, the patient should be advised to seek further medical attention.

6. Ask the patient if the pain radiates anywhere, particularly the left arm or jaw, which could indicate a heart problem. Pay attention to answers suggesting the pain is spreading or worsening. Also ask if he's experienced any recent weight loss, fever, or night sweats, which could indicate a more serious underlying condition.
