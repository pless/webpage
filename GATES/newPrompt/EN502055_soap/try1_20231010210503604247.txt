First, you have not provided a diagnosis or treatment plan, so I can't comment on their consistency.

Second, the diagnosis is not provided but the symptoms (fever and headache) are consistent with malaria, which is common in Nigeria. 

Third, a Malaria test would be helpful in this case given the symptoms and location. 

Fourth, the patient has amenorrhea for 1 month, which may indicate possible pregnancy. 

Fifth, these symptoms could be signs of serious problems such as meningitis, malaria, or pregnancy complication. The Malaria test can help rule out or confirm malaria. A urine analysis may detect pregnancy. If these tests are positive, appropriate treatment should be initiated immediately.

Sixth, ask the patient if she has had any unprotected sexual activity recently or changes in menstrual cycle. If she confirms, it could signify potential pregnancy. Also, ask about other symptoms like neck stiffness or sensitivity to light, which could point towards meningitis. Be attentive to answers that confirm these symptoms or scenarios.
