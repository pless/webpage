1. The treatment appears to be consistent with the diagnosis, which seems to be an upper respiratory infection given the prescription of Loratadine for catarrh and Paracetamol for possible pain or fever.

2. The diagnosis is not stated explicitly in the note, but based on the treatment plan, it can be inferred that it might be a common cold or a sinus infection. These are consistent with the observation of catarrh.

3. Additional tests like Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, and Urine analysis are not necessary for this case, as the symptoms do not suggest these diseases. 

4. Notable is the lack of a stated diagnosis or differential diagnosis. Also, the blood pressure is not recorded.

5. These symptoms can be signs of a more serious problem like a bacterial sinus infection. However, given the patient's age and the duration of symptoms, it's likely a viral infection. If symptoms persist after the treatment, consider a bacterial infection.

6. Questions: 
    - Has the child had a fever? A "yes" could indicate a more serious infection.
    - Has there been any change in behavior, like being unusually irritable or lethargic? This could indicate a more serious illness.
    - Is the child eating and drinking normally? A "no" could indicate dehydration or a more serious illness.
