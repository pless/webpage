First, the treatment with Loratadine and Paracetamol is consistent with the diagnosis of catarrh, as these medications help relieve symptoms such as runny nose and fever.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the patient's symptom of catarrh, although it's not clear if there are any other symptoms.

Third, given the limited tests available, no further tests seem necessary for catarrh. 

Fourth, it's notable that the patient's blood pressure wasn't measured, which is unusual. 

Fifth, while catarrh is typically not serious, it could be a sign of a more serious condition like an infection if accompanied by high fever or difficulty breathing. To rule this out, you could monitor the patient's temperature and ask about other symptoms. 

Sixth, ask: 
1. Has the patient had any other symptoms, such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing? Be attentive to answers indicating more serious symptoms.
2. Has the catarrh gotten worse over the 5 days? A worsening condition could be a sign of a more serious problem.
