Without any given diagnosis, treatment plan, or differential diagnosis, I cannot assess whether the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. 

A physical example like fever could be helpful in this case. It's also worth considering conducting a malaria test given the symptoms and the location (Nigeria).

Without information on the treatment plan or any diagnosis, it's hard to point out anything else notable. 

These symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem like pneumonia or tuberculosis. A physical examination focusing on the patient's lungs and a history of similar symptoms would help rule these out. If these cannot be ruled out, the patient should be referred to a larger hospital for further tests and treatment. 

Questions to ask: 
1. "Have you had a fever?" Fever is a common symptom of malaria and could indicate a more serious infection. 
2. "Have you experienced any weight loss or night sweats?" These could indicate tuberculosis.
3. "Have you had similar symptoms in the past?" This could help identify any chronic conditions.
4. "Is there any chest pain or difficulty breathing?" This could indicate a more serious condition like pneumonia.
5. "Have you been around anyone with similar symptoms?" This could indicate an infectious disease. 

Pay attention to answers indicating a positive fever, weight loss, night sweats, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and exposure to others with similar symptoms.
