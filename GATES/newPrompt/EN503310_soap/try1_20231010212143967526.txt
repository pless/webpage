Without the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment plan, it's impossible to provide a comprehensive review. However, I can give some preliminary advice based on the symptoms:

1. Consistency of treatment with diagnosis: Unclear, as no diagnosis or treatment is provided.
2. Consistency of diagnosis with observations: Unclear, as no diagnosis is provided.
3. Additional tests: A test for malaria could be appropriate, given the patient's location and symptoms. If the patient has a fever, a typhoid test could also be considered.
4. Notability: The patient's symptoms could indicate a common cold, flu, or a more serious condition like pneumonia or malaria. The duration and severity of symptoms, as well as any additional symptoms like fever or difficulty breathing, would be important to note.
5. Seriousness: These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like pneumonia or malaria. Further testing and monitoring of symptoms would be necessary to rule these out.
6. Questions: 
   - "Have you had a fever?" Fever could indicate a more serious infection like malaria or pneumonia.
   - "Have you been having difficulty breathing?" This could indicate a more serious respiratory condition.
   - "Have you noticed any changes in your urine?" Changes in urine color or frequency can indicate different health conditions.
   - "Have you been in contact with anyone sick recently?" This can help identify if the patient might have contracted a contagious disease.

Pay attention to positive responses to these questions, as they may indicate a more serious condition than a common cold or flu.
