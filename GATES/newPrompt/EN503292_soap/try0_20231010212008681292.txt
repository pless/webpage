1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Tinea corporis (ringworm), a common fungal infection. Erythromycin and Hydrocortisone cream are often used to treat this condition.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observation of skin rashes.
3. No other physical examples or tests would be helpful in this case as the diagnosis and treatment are consistent with the symptoms presented.
4. Nothing else notable.
5. Skin rashes can be a sign of more serious problems, like an allergic reaction or an infectious disease. Given the current diagnosis and treatment, it doesn't seem likely. However, if the rashes worsen or don't improve, further investigation would be needed.
6. Ask: (1) "Have you been in contact with someone with similar symptoms?" - if yes, it could suggest a contagious condition. (2) "Have you been exposed to any new substances (e.g., detergents, plants, foods) recently?" - if yes, it could indicate an allergic reaction.
