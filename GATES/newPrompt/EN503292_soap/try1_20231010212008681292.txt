1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Tinea corporis, a fungal infection of the skin.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the patient's symptom of skin rashes.
3. A physical example of the rash might be helpful to understand its exact nature. No additional tests are required.
4. Notable is the lack of other symptoms or complaints, indicating a localized issue.
5. These symptoms could indicate a more serious underlying problem like an allergic reaction or systemic disease. However, the absence of other symptoms makes this less likely. If the rash doesn't improve with treatment, referral to a specialist may be needed.
6. Questions: 
   - Have you been in contact with anyone with similar symptoms?
   - Have you used any new products (soap, lotion) recently?
   - Have you been in any unusual environments recently (woods, new building)?
   - Any history of allergies?
   Be attentive to answers indicating a possible allergen, new product/environment, or contact with infected individuals.
