The information provided is incomplete to provide a full review. However, based on the available data:

1. No treatment or diagnosis is mentioned, so it cannot be assessed if they are consistent.

2. The diagnosis is not given, thus it cannot be compared with the observations. 

3. Given the symptoms of fever, headache, and vomiting, tests for Malaria and Typhoid could be helpful.

4. Notable is the patient's pale appearance, which could indicate Anemia. A test for Anemia could be useful.

5. These symptoms could be indicative of a serious problem like Malaria, Typhoid, or Anemia. Testing for these conditions would help rule them out. If tests are positive, appropriate treatment should be initiated. 

6. Questions to ask: 
- "How long have you had these symptoms?" (Sudden onset could indicate acute conditions)
- "Have you noticed any blood in your vomit or stool?" (Blood could indicate a severe condition like gastrointestinal bleeding or severe Malaria). Be attentive to any positive responses.
