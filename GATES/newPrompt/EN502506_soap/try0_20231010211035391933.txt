First, the treatment plan and diagnosis are not stated in the note, so I cannot comment on their consistency.

Second, the diagnosis is not provided. However, the symptoms of fever, headache, and vomiting, along with pallor, could suggest several conditions like Malaria, Typhoid, Anemia, etc.

Third, a Malaria and Typhoid test would be useful given the patient's symptoms and location. Anemia test can provide additional information due to the observed pallor.

Fourth, the blood pressure is not provided which is an important vital sign.

Fifth, these symptoms could be a sign of a serious problem like severe anemia, typhoid, or malaria. Tests for these conditions could help rule them out. If tests are positive, appropriate treatment should be started.

Sixth, ask the patient: 
1. How long have you had these symptoms? Pay attention to duration of more than a week.
2. Do you have any pain, especially in the abdomen? Severe typhoid can cause abdominal pain.
3. Have you noticed any unusual bleeding or bruising? This may suggest severe anemia or hemorrhagic fever.
