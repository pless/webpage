1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Antiemetics, analgesics, and antacids are typical in treating peptic ulcers and associated symptoms.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and weakness align with a peptic ulcer.
3. A test for H. pylori could be helpful in confirming peptic ulcer, but it's not available. Anemia test might be useful given the weakness, to rule out blood loss from the ulcer.
4. Notable is the repeated treatment plan. Ensure it's not an error leading to overdose.
5. Yes, these symptoms could indicate a perforated ulcer, a serious condition. The absence of severe pain and signs of peritonitis might rule this out. If not, referral to a better-equipped facility is needed.
6. Ask about changes in stool color (black/tarry indicates bleeding ulcer), and if pain improves after eating (typical of gastric ulcers). Be attentive to "yes" answers.
