1. Treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Dietary counseling is appropriate for a patient with a family history of diabetes who is also overweight (BMI 31 kg/m2).
2. Diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has a family history of diabetes and a high BMI, both risk factors for developing diabetes.
3. An additional test could be a urine analysis. This could detect the presence of sugar or proteins in the urine, potential indicators of diabetes. 
4. Notable is the patient's headache. This could be a symptom of high blood pressure or other conditions.
5. Persistent headaches can signify serious problems like hypertension or brain tumors. As blood pressure is normal, a brain tumor is unlikely but cannot be ruled out. If the headache persists, the patient should seek further medical care.
6. Ask the patient about the nature of the headache (throbbing, constant, intermittent) and if there are any associated symptoms (nausea, vision changes). Also ask about their dietary habits, particularly sugar intake. Be attentive to severe, persistent headaches, sudden onset headaches, or headaches associated with other neurological symptoms. Also, pay attention to high sugar intake or a diet high in processed foods.
