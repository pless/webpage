First: Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Antimalarial drugs are being used to treat Plasmodium falciparum malaria. 

Second: Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the symptoms. Fever and headache are common symptoms of malaria.

Third: A Typhoid test could be useful as it also presents with similar symptoms to malaria.

Fourth: The patient appears to be acutely ill and in moderate distress, which is significant.

Fifth: Yes, these symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like meningitis. A lumbar puncture would rule this out but it's not available. Monitor symptoms closely and if they worsen, refer to a better-equipped facility.

Sixth: Ask: 
1. "Have you had any neck stiffness or sensitivity to light?" - Look out for a 'Yes' answer, which can indicate meningitis.
2. "Have you been in contact with anyone who is ill?" - Look out for 'Yes', indicating possible infectious disease.
