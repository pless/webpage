1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The Noristerat injection is an appropriate method of contraceptive management.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient came in requesting family planning, and contraceptive management was the diagnosis.

3. No additional physical examples or tests would be necessary in this context. The patient's request for contraception doesn't warrant further testing.

4. Notable is the absence of details regarding the patient's medical history, particularly regarding prior use of contraceptives and any adverse reactions.

5. These symptoms are not indicative of a serious problem. The patient is seeking contraception, not reporting any concerning symptoms. 

6. I should ask the patient:
   - "Have you ever had any adverse reactions to contraceptives in the past?" Be attentive to any hormonal imbalances or allergic reactions.
   - "Do you have any known medical conditions?" Particularly be attentive to conditions like hypertension, blood clotting disorders, or cancers that can be affected by hormonal contraceptives.
