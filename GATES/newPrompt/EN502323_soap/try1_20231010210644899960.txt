Third: No additional tests are necessary. The patient's request was specific to family planning and she did not present any symptoms that would require further testing.

Fourth: Nothing else notable.

Fifth: The symptoms, in this case a request for family planning, do not indicate a serious problem. There are no other symptoms to rule out a serious problem.

Sixth: Questions to ask could include: "Have you experienced any side effects from previous contraceptives?" and "Are you currently sexually active?"
