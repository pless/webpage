1) The treatment, metronidazole and magnesium trisilicate, seems to target bacterial infection and reduce stomach acid respectively, which could be consistent with abdominal and pelvic pain. 

2) The diagnosis is consistent with the observations, as abdominal pain and vomiting are common symptoms of abdominal and pelvic issues.

3) Additional tests like Urine analysis could be helpful to rule out urinary tract infection, which can also cause abdominal pain.

4) Notable is the lack of differential diagnosis. This could be due to limited resources, but it's important to consider other potential causes.

5) These symptoms could be signs of a serious problem like appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy. Without imaging, these can't be fully ruled out. If pain worsens or patient develops fever, immediate referral to a better equipped facility is needed.

6) Ask about the location and nature of the pain (sharp, dull, constant, intermittent), and any changes in bowel movements or urine. For women, ask about menstrual cycle and possibility of pregnancy. Pay attention to signs of acute appendicitis (sharp, localized pain, possible fever) and possible pregnancy in women.
