1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Metronidazole is used to treat infections and magnesium trisilicate is used to treat abdominal pain.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations of abdominal pain and vomiting.
3. A urine analysis could be useful to rule out urinary tract infection. 
4. Notable is the lack of differential diagnosis. 
5. Yes, these symptoms could be signs of a more serious problem such as appendicitis or ectopic pregnancy. An ultrasound would be ideal to rule these out but if not possible, monitor the patient closely for worsening symptoms.
6. Ask the patient if the pain is localized or generalized and if they have any urinary or bowel changes. If the pain is localized, particularly to the right lower quadrant, or if there are urinary changes, these could indicate appendicitis or UTI respectively.
