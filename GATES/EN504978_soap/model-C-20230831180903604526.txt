
These presenting symptoms should be evaluated with tests to rule out life-threatening diagnoses like meningitis or seizures, potentially including neuroimaging like a CT scan head, depending on location and access. Given this patient presents with severe headache and body pain and has not improved after antipyretic administration, the differential diagnosis should be considered. If she has meningitis or seizures, immediate admission to a larger hospital is necessary. (Meningitis can present with a similar range of symptoms in children depending on their age). (If there is another facility nearby, that can be considered as well, as access in the rural area may be limited, or the patient may require specialized care).
