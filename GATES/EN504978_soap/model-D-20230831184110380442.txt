
 The diagnosis appears consistent with influenza (influenza-like illness, ILI), which can present just with fever without respiratory symptoms more typical of pneumonia with the same presentation. However, given the high index of suspicion and the presentation, influenza should still be considered in the differential.
 Testing for influenza is not always routine in rural health clinics. Even in urban settings, the decision to test is often based on clinical judgment, the patient' presentations, and possibly the age of the patient.
 Further investigation into other causes of fever and body ache, like malaria, would depend on the location and the season. In contrast, malaria is more endemic in certain parts of Africa than here.
 Any influenza diagnostic tests would be based on rapid antigen tests. PCR would not be done, as this requires specialized labs.
 The management will still be a supportive care with rest, hydration, and perhaps antiviral therapy, if available.  
The other things that may suggest or confirm pneumonia are X-ray or CT scan results. Those are not readily available in most clinics. X-ray is often sent to a neighboring city or a specialized hospital. A CT scan is usually beyond the resources of most primary care clinics.
