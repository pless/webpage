Based on the information provided, I am unable to answer the four questions as there seems to be missing data. 

The diagnosis and differential diagnosis are not mentioned, and the treatment plan is also not specified. Thus, I am unable to assess whether the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. 

As for additional tests, depending on the patient's specific symptoms and medical history, a complete blood count (CBC) could be helpful to rule out infections or anemia, which can cause headaches and body pain. Also, a simple urine test might be useful to rule out a urinary tract infection.

However, as the patient's medical history, symptoms details, and examination findings are not fully provided, it's hard to suggest other possible tests or notable observations. 

Please provide more detailed information for a more accurate response.
