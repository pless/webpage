
The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis since the patient has a fever with headache that could be suggestive of malaria. However, you should consider other causes of fever like influenza, typhoid, or other bacterial infections. You should conduct necessary tests to confirm the diagnosis. In this case, the Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) was done. In a rural setting, other tests you might consider would be a full blood count (including malaria-specific markers), serum electrolytes, blood culture for any bacterial or viral causes of fever. A sputum smear and culture might also be considered.

There are other symptoms that should be considered in this patient, like joint pain and swelling since malaria can cause joint inflammation.
Another important consideration is the possibility of drug resistant infections. Most times, the health worker should conduct an interview to gather details about the patient's malarious and travel history. He should also be counseled to prevent further transmission of the disease.
