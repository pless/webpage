
Your assessment of suspected malaria given the patient's symptoms and physical examination results is appropriate. The malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is a simple and quick test that can confirm malaria infection. It's essential to use appropriate treatment promptly when presenting with symptoms consistent with malaria, which will help prevent complications. Other conditions, such as meningitis, must be considered if the patient's fever persists or if other systemic symptoms are present.
Further evaluation for the presence of malaria parasites is indicated, either by microscopy or RDT test in the specific setting.
Given the patient's age and the findings, an initial treatment plan could include chloroquine or artemether-lumefantrine, as per the local treatment guidelines. The patient should be educated on drug adherence and the need to take follow-up blood tests to monitor parasite clearance. 
If symptoms persist, particularly if fever duration is longer than 48 hours, you should consider other causes and seek advice from a malaria expert. 
### Next Steps: 
Consider the follow-up plan: Given the patient's location and potential exposure to other conditions, it would be beneficial to review the patient in a few days for further assessment or potentially to repeat the malaria RDT. This would ensure prompt detection and treatment of any recrudescent infection or other potential complications.
### Additional Considerations: 
Early diagnosis of malaria can prevent many complications. Malaria is endemic in many parts of the region, and prompt treatment with effective antimalarials can significantly reduce the risk of severe and potentially life-threatening complications. Early intervention strategies, including antimalarial treatment and potentially pre-emptive treatment of close contacts, are important public health strategies to prevent transmission.
### Conclusion: 
Your differential diagnosis of meningitis in the context of the patient's fever history was appropriate, but the suspected diagnosis of malaria remains given the patient's symptoms and the positive RDT result. A follow-up plan was discussed to ensure early detection of any potential recrudescent infections. Further investigations may be necessary if symptoms persist or if other systemic symptoms develop. Given the endemic nature of malaria in the patient's area, it is crucial to continue to educate patients with the need to report any fever symptoms promptly to avoid serious complications.
