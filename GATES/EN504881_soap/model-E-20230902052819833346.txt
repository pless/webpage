Based on the information provided, it's impossible to answer your questions accurately. There is no diagnosis or treatment plan listed, making it impossible to determine if they are consistent with the observations or each other. Additionally, without a clear diagnosis, it's difficult to suggest other tests. However, considering the patient's complaint of a headache for 2 days, some basic tests that could be done in a rural clinic might include a complete blood count (CBC) to check for infection, and a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes. 

One notable thing is the lack of information. It's crucial to record a thorough history of the patient's symptoms, any previous medical conditions, and the results of any physical examination. This will help in coming up with a differential diagnosis and, subsequently, a treatment plan.
