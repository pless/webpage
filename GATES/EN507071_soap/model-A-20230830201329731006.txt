  Great, thank you for sharing the case scenario with me! Based on the information provided, here are my answers to your 4 questions:
1. Consistency of treatment with diagnosis: Yes, the treatment plan of applying antallergic eye drops 3 times a day for 2 weeks and prescribing cetrizine 5mg tablets as needed is consistent with the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis.
2. Consistency of diagnosis with observations: Yes, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is consistent with the patient's history of red eyes with itching and discharge for 2 days.
3. Other tests that might be available in a rural health clinic: Since the patient is experiencing red eyes and itching, it would be appropriate to perform a Schirmer's test to assess the tear production. Additionally, a fluorescein dye test could be conducted to evaluate the patient's tear film and diagnose any dry eye conditions.
4. Notable aspects of the case: The patient's symptoms are relatively mild, and the diagnosis is straightforward. However, it is important to note that allergic conjunctivitis can be a chronic condition, and the patient may require ongoing treatment to manage their symptoms. Additionally, it is essential to consider other potential causes of red eyes, such as bacterial conjunctivitis or dry eye syndrome, and to rule them out through further evaluation.
