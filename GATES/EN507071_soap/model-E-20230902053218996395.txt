Firstly, the treatment appears to be consistent with the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Antazoline and Tetrahydrozoline eye drops are commonly used to relieve symptoms of eye allergies, and cetrizine is an antihistamine that can help to alleviate systemic symptoms.

Secondly, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's main symptoms were red, itchy eyes with discharge, which are common symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

Thirdly, in a rural health clinic, further tests may be limited. However, a visual acuity test could be performed to ensure the patient's vision has not been affected. Additionally, if the patient's symptoms do not improve with treatment, further investigation may be needed to rule out other conditions such as bacterial or viral conjunctivitis. In such cases, a swab of the conjunctival discharge could be taken for culture and sensitivity, if available.

Lastly, it is notable that the patient's blood pressure was not recorded. In a young child, this is not typically a concern, but it is generally good practice to record all vital signs during a medical examination. Additionally, there was no mention of whether the patient had a history of allergies, which could be relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.
