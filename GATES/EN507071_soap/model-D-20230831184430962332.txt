However, It is important to continue to note symptoms and adjust the antihistamine accordingly because some patients may require additional therapy depending on their symptoms. The availability of some more advanced diagnostic tests like the allergen skin prick test may be challenging in a rural health clinic. But it is essential to remain alert to other conditions, such as conjunctivitis caused by a bacterial infection, and refer the patient to a specialist if necessary. Any notable signs or symptoms that suggest otherwise should be observed, and another diagnosis considered. This may include contact lens conjunctivitis, iritis, or other systemic conditions like allergy (asthma), sinusitis, or rhinitis.
