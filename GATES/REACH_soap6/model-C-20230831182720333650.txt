
 Consistency of the treatment with the diagnosis: Good. This patient has signs of an acute upper respiratory infection. In a rural area, where specialized laboratory investigation may be lacking, her clinical presentation supports the diagnosis of a cold, and this treatment is appropriate.
 Could other issues be tested? One possibility that could be tested is tuberculosis, which could manifest similarly, but may require chest X-ray to confirm, and testing for it would depend on the patient's exposure. One other possibility that I can think of is allergic rhinitis, which similarly presents with nasal congestion and cough. However, this could not be evaluated adequately without further examination. Further consultation with a specialist may be necessary.
 Is there anything else to do? No, this is a relatively straightforward case. The patient's signs and symptoms can be managed conservatively. Regular appointments with follow-ups would be a good idea. 
 Is there anything else notable? The patient has a good appetite, is nonsmoker, and has normal vital signs. That is good for recovery.
