Given the information provided:

1. Without a clear diagnosis, it's difficult to evaluate if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. However, the medications prescribed are used to treat symptoms that the patient is experiencing. Danacid is often used to reduce stomach acid and relieve heartburn, and paracetamol is used to reduce fever and relieve pain.

2. The symptoms presented by the patient such as heartburn, stomach discomfort, and fever can be consistent with a variety of diagnoses. More information is needed to confirm a diagnosis.

3. In a rural health clinic, additional tests that could be useful include a complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of infection or anemia, a stool test for Helicobacter pylori bacteria which can cause peptic ulcers, a urine test for urinary tract infection which can sometimes present with abdominal discomfort, and a pregnancy test if applicable.

4. Notable is the duration for which the medications have been prescribed. It seems unusual to prescribe these medications for 7 years and 3 years respectively. It's possible this is a typographical error. Normally, these medications would be prescribed for a shorter duration, and the patient would be advised to return if symptoms persist. Also, the blood pressure is on the higher side of normal, which might need monitoring or further investigation.
