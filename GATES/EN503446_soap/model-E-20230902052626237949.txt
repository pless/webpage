Firstly, the treatment seems consistent with the diagnosis of peptic ulcer. The medicines prescribed (clarithromycin, metronidazole, and omeprazole) are typically used for treatment of ulcers and Helicobacter pylori infection which is a common cause of peptic ulcers. 

Secondly, the diagnosis of peptic ulcer is consistent with the patient's chief complaint and history of presenting illness. However, more information about the patient's symptoms would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

Thirdly, in terms of additional tests, a complete blood count (CBC) could be useful in checking for anemia that could be caused by bleeding from the ulcer. Also, a stool test could be conducted to check for the presence of occult blood which would indicate bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Both these tests should be feasible in a rural health clinic.

Fourthly, it is notable that the patient has a diagnosis of "acute peptic ulcer with perforation." This is a serious condition that typically requires surgical intervention. The treatment plan, however, does not mention any surgical intervention or referral to a higher level of care. This could potentially be a problem if the patient indeed has a perforated ulcer.
