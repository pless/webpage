
 The management plan for this patient is reasonable, considering a peptic ulcer presentation with perforation. A Helicobacter pylori (Immunofluorescent Assay) was performed and found positive. So eradication therapy with two antibiotics and acid reducers was rightly planned. Only the local laboratory should have been utilized for this test to be cost-effective. Also, the lab results could have been requested earlier to confirm the H. pylori status. There isn't anything else notable apart from the obvious plan. 

If you have any reservations, kindly let me know, and we can discuss.
