
Your patient presents with abdominal pain of two days' duration. This could be related to any disorder, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or even gynecologic disorders. These conditions should be investigated with the appropriate tests, including blood tests such as chemistry and complete blood count (CBC). However, in a rural health clinic, the tests that might be readily available could include a complete blood count (CBC) and a basic metabolic panel (BMP). We recommend a full metabolic panel and urinalysis. The patient should also have a review of systems and a physical examination. The next step will depend on the laboratory results.
