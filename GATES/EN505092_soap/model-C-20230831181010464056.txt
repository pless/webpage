
This patient's abdominal pain suggests a non-specific gastrointestiinal complaint. The absence of fever or chills, along with the limited history, suggests she may have food poisoning, which a doctor would diagnose with clinical data. She should be given fluids to stay hydrated and possibly provided with antidiarrheal medication. If her symptoms persist or worsen, or if there are specific signs of other pathologies (such as peritonitis), further tests may be necessary, and a referral to a specialist might be indicated. In primary care, we generally do not order more definitive diagnostic tests like CT scans unless there is a high likelihood of a very serious pathology given the patient's symptoms.

What you need to do: While the diagnosis appears to be non-specific gastroenteritis, given the patient's history of food poisoning, a thorough discussion of the diet and potential water contamination should occur. She can be given guidelines about how to prevent food poisoning and be referred to secondary care if she fails to recover within a reasonable time.
