
 Your assessment is excellent, given the rural environment. Based on the patient's presentation, it is reasonable to consider pneumonia, and she does fit criteria, including fever and chills and a productive cough with yellow sputum. Given that pneumonia is a life-threatening diagnosis in this environment, it would be important to consider pneumonia as a differential diagnosis and perform a chest X-ray, at least for confirmation of the diagnosis and to start treatment. An arterial blood gas would possibly be ordered given the patient's symptoms and the differential diagnosis. Lab tests such as blood cultures are usually ordered but may take several hours to return, and a urinalysis may be useful to check for kidney damage if antibiotics are given too early. Depending on the severity of this case, intravenous antibiotics may be necessary for a life-threatening case. The patient should be referred to a local hospital for more specialized care. Given this setting, these tests may be ordered: chest X-ray, arterial blood gas, blood cultures, urinalysis and another blood analysis within 72 hours. Referral to a higher facility should also be considered due to the seriousness of the diagnosis. This is a patient with presumptive pneumonia who needs serious management.

These tests would not be practical for a primary care clinic in a rural environment. However, depending on resources available, some may be warranted to ensure early diagnosis and control. It is important to handle with haste to prevent serious complications. This is a case with serious considerations, and we must act carefully and promptly.
