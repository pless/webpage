Without more information, it's impossible to accurately answer your questions. The diagnosis and treatment plans are not listed, and the differential diagnosis is also absent. The notes only include the patient's symptoms, which are chest pain and backaches, and their blood pressure reading.

However, based on the given information, the chest pain could be due to various conditions such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, or even gastroesophageal reflux disease. It might be helpful to conduct an EKG if available, to rule out any heart-related conditions. 

Please provide more information so I can give a more in-depth analysis.
