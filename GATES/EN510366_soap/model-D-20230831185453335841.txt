
While the diagnosis and treatment are appropriate, there are some potential issues with the plan. The patient's recent travel history suggests the possibility of chloroquine-resistant malaria infection. However, based on the presentation, treatment with artemether-lumefantrine combination is reasonable. However, the patient should be monitored for potential complications, such as cerebral malaria. 
The risk of serious complications like hypoglycaemia needs to be assessed and managed. Given the limited resources and lack of investigational capabilities in this rural area, it would be appropriate to consider malaria testing using a rapid diagnostic test based on the travel history. The next step would be to manage the illness accordingly. (In this case, considering referral as a potential option.)
