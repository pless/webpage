Specifically, typhoid fever or meningitis could cause similar presentations. Finally (as for the patient), I would assess BP and temperature due to their potential significance. There are few diagnostic tests in rural settings. So you may need multiple forms to detect malaria in such cases. [Separate this to the next line and format as code.] If you want to know different ways of managing malaria in endemic rural settings, let me know, and I'll be happy to explore. [End] The response suggests that the diagnosis is consistent with the patient's presentation, and other conditions should be considered due to the rural setting.
