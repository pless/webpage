
Generally, this patient's symptoms, age, and sex suggest malaria (Plasmodium sp.), which is a confirmed diagnosis. The treatment plan is reasonable: Paracetamol and Artemether-Lumefantrine treatment for uncomplicated malaria as recommended by the WHO. The recommendations by the hospital should be followed regarding vector control, prevention of reinfestation, and following up the patient 3 days after the last treatment to assess his progress and rule out other possible causes of fever. There is no mention of other tests to confirm the diagnosis, which may be available in urban health facilities, such as rapid diagnostic test (RDTs) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in rural areas. The doctor should however, consider that a bacterial cause for fever like typhoid may need more rapid treatment and a different course of medicine in case of a confirmed diagnosis.
