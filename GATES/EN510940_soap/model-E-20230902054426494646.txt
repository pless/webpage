First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Amoxicillin is commonly used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), as it is effective against the bacteria usually responsible for these infections. 

Second, it's hard to say if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations, because the notes don't include any details about the symptoms the patient was experiencing or the results of any tests that might have been performed. UTIs in infants can present with symptoms like fever, irritability, poor feeding, or vomiting, but none of these symptoms are mentioned in the notes.

Third, in a rural health clinic, tests that could be performed to confirm a UTI include a urine test to look for bacteria and white blood cells, which are signs of infection. If a urine test isn't possible, the health worker could look for physical signs of a UTI, such as a fever or tenderness in the lower abdomen.

Fourth, it's notable that the patient is an infant. UTIs in infants can be serious, so it's important to monitor the patient closely to ensure the infection is clearing. If the symptoms persist or worsen, the infant might need to be referred to a hospital for further testing and treatment. Also, the dosage of amoxicillin should be carefully calculated based on the weight of the infant to ensure it's safe and effective.
