
Consistency: Yes, the diagnosis is supported by the patient's symptoms, examination findings, and lab results.
Available tests: In a rural health clinic, rapid urine strips (Leukocyte esterase) or dipstick urinalysis might be the only tests available.
Notable: UTI is a common condition, but it is important to identify the site correctly to differentiate it from uni- or multifocal pyelonephritis. If this is not possible based on the current examination findings, imaging might be required.
If the patient's symptoms indicate pyelonephritis, imaging with radiography of the urinary pyelogram should be considered. It could be that the patient's presentation is due to sepsis, a systemic complication of primary pyelonephritis, making it difficult to diagnose the site.

Overall, the UTI diagnosis is supported, but additional tests and imaging could help confirm or change the diagnosis.
