
 Based on the information provided, this patient's UTI is likely due to E. coli or Proteus. However, as UTIs can take up to 48 hours to get noticeable symptoms, it's possible there could be other causes for symptoms. If the patient does not experience any improvement or there are new symptoms, further investigation might be indicated. Depending on the type of infection and the patient's age, a urine culture or other tests (like a urine routine examination) to confirm the diagnosis and appropriately treat the infection. It might also be advisable to assess the patient's fluid intake, as dehydration can cause symptoms like pyelonephritis.

Diagnosis is not consistent with the observations. The patient's leukocytosis and left shift suggest pyelonephritis rather than UTI specifically. It may be worth considering other tests like urine culture or urine routine examination to confirm the diagnosis.

There are additional tests that could be considered available in a rural health clinic like a urine culture or a Gram stain, depending on the laboratory facility.

The patient's history and physical examination suggest pyelonephritis rather than a simple UTI. Further evaluation will be necessary to confirm the management. Please report and provide the patient's further details and the management plan, if any.
