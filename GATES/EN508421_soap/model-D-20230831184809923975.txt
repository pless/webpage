
Your approach is correct, but for clarity, it might be better to provide a differential diagnosis for Cough. For example Chest illness, Pulmonary Tuberculosis, Viral Lower Respiratory tract infection, Secondary Infection should be listed under differential diagnosis.
For this case, the differential diagnoses could include pneumonia, tuberculosis, acute bronchitis, lung cancer, among others. 
It is important to continue to ask questions, especially about the quality of the cough and presence of any secondary signs. Also, consider the results of the blood test if performed.
Other tests that might be available in a rural health clinic, but depending on the clinical presentation, could be done, include routine blood count, urinalysis, chest X-ray, or sputum smear.
You may also use other clinical tools such as chest percussion to help guide further management. However, the initial management here is correct.

However, I would suggest further clarification for the Plan. A longer antibiotic course than five days may be warranted depending on the severity of the cough, but this is not specified in the plan. Additionally, it is unclear if there is a plan for the patient’s follow-up. 

Overall, your approach is correct, but you may need to consider other differential diagnoses or details for further management. [18]
