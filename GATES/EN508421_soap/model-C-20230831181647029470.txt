
The diagnosis is consistent with pneumonia (community-acquired pneumonia) given the cough and fever. The physical examination findings are consistent with pneumonia. However, the presentation of cough and fever should always raise the suspicion of Pneumonia before Tuberculosis. In rural areas, rapid diagnostic tests such as Smear microscopy and chest X-rays are not always available, but a diagnosis should be made on clinical grounds. If clinical findings suggest pneumonia, an antibiotic should be prescribed and the patient should be monitored for signs of complications. If further investigation is required for instance, an x-ray, this patient should be referred.  If a smear shows smear-positive pneumonia, you would be more certain you know what you're dealing with. If the microbiological tests are available, they can be used. However, if such is not possible, it's not always possible to provide definitive diagnosis.  There other conditions that can present this way, such as bacterial pneumonia or viral pneumonia. There is one thing I want further questioning on, you have considered Tuberculosis as an possibility, and that's a very important consideration. But the information provided does not support that the patient has Tuberculosis due to the duration of symptoms and the HPI.
