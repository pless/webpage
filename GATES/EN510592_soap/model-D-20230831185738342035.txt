The patient would likely require a course of artemether-lumefentrin, with additional treatment for fever and pain. [2] The patient needs continued monitoring for potential complications such as anemia and severe malaria. There are no other tests or measures that would be feasible or appropriate for this case in a rural health clinic. [3]
