
This sounds like a classic case of malaria. The symptoms, including headache, cold, and hotness of the body, could suggest falciparum malaria, which is the most severe form of the disease. Given the patient's age and other medical history, this diagnosis is reasonable. However, other conditions, such as typhid fever, should also be considered. Given the remote location, available testing, including a blood smear could help confirm the diagnosis. However, given the rural setting and available resources, a blood smear may not always be available, and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria could be used. For follow up, it would be important to keep the patient on appropriate treatment and monitor their symptoms for any signs of relapse.

The patient's weight loss should also be monitored, as this and other constitutional symptoms could suggest other comorbidity, like tuberculosis, and should be ruled out. 

The presence of fever, even if not high, also raises the suspicion of another condition, like typhoid fever or a respiratory infection. This patient should be monitored for any signs of these potentially serious conditions over several days.

Overall, this is a common condition in this area, especially in young adults, and while it is not acute, it can be severe if not properly managed.
