
Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Most likely, this is an upper respiratory infection and may need antibiotics if symptoms persist for a long time. The patient should remain at home and be encouraged to take oral rehydration solution and rest.
The diagnosis is consistent with the observations because the infant presents with symptoms of upper respiratory infection including a mild cough and discharge from both eyes. The patient is also fully immunized. Nothing else stands out.
This case needs further follow-ups to confirm whether treatment is helpful. The antibiotics given are a local recommendation for ARIs. The patient should be educated more on how to care for her baby's health. The infant is a low birth weight baby and needs special care. Perhaps a referral to a specialist may be considered.
