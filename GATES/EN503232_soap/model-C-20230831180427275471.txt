
 The treatment appears to be consistent with the diagnosis. However, given the location of the clinic, one might assume that other tests might be available. If you suspect a co-infection, tests for sexually transmitted infections may be valuable. In such cases, a rapid test for syphilis or HIV would be a good idea. 
Another thing to note is that even though a pregnancy test found negative, there might be concerns about whether they are genuinely non-pregnant. It might be good to confirm this during follow-up. Finally, because this person mentioned planning for pregnancy, it might be worth discussing family planning options with her since unintended pregnancies can have serious consequences in areas with limited access to healthcare.
 Lastly, it may be worth considering non-sexually transmitted infections in the differential diagnosis of a sexually active woman presenting with abnormal bleeding.
