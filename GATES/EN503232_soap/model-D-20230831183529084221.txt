There are several reasons why a health worker may choose to discuss family planning during a routine consultation about another condition. There is, however, no need for any additional investigations, because the diagnosis was clearly established (pregnancy).  However it could be useful to ensure that the patient understands the correct use of contraception, as misuse can result in unplanned pregnancy. There also may be social desirability bias, and it may be necessary to check for this in follow-up. The plan seems appropriate.

[Note] The primary reason for consultation was pregnancy, and the investigation was negative, and the patient will likely need routine antenatal care. It is possible that future consultations may focus more on antenatal care given that family planning is included in routine care at this stage. It’s worth noting that in some contexts, family planning and antenatal care would be combined.
