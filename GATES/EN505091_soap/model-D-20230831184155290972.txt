

* Consistency: Good. This presentation is consistent with diverticulitis.
* Additional tests: No. The patient's symptoms suggest diverticulitis, a condition that typically requires broad-spectrum antibiotics, and not specialist referral.
* Other notable points: Diverticulitis is generally a treatable condition. Management requires clear communication of the patient's condition to other household members to minimize the risk of complications such as sepsis. The patient should be advised to avoid food with high fiber content and maintain adequate hydration. The patient can be discharged once symptoms have improved and there is no risk of worsening.
* Management plan: Prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics, and monitor for signs of complications such as worsening abdominal pain, fever, or changes in bowel movements. Check the patient's vitals, abdominal tenderness, and other symptoms daily until symptoms improve. At each visit, re-evaluate the diagnosis based on this information, and modify this management plan as needed. Monitor the patient's progress and adjust therapies accordingly until they are discharged. If there is no risk of complications or if symptoms do not improve, consider discharge.

There are other potential causes such as constipation, bowel obstruction, or appendicitis, but based on the patient's symptoms, the next best step is to start them on antibiotics and monitor closely for any red flags or complications.
