1. The treatment plan is consistent with the diagnosis of secondary hypertension. The patient is already on Lisinopril, a medication commonly used to treat high blood pressure. Further, the advice to exercise regularly, avoid salt intake, and manage stress (implied by the suggestion to "be entertained before going to bed") are all standard lifestyle modifications recommended for managing hypertension.

2. The diagnosis of secondary hypertension is somewhat consistent with the observations. The patient's blood pressure reading is slightly elevated, which aligns with a hypertension diagnosis. However, the patient's complaint of recent sleep disturbances isn't necessarily indicative of hypertension, as it could be due to a variety of other causes.

3. As a rural health worker, you might not have access to extensive diagnostic equipment or specialists. However, secondary hypertension is usually caused by an underlying condition. Given the patient's recent sleep disturbances, it might be useful to test for sleep apnea if possible, as this condition can cause secondary hypertension. Basic kidney function tests (urea, creatinine) could also be considered, as kidney disease is a common cause of secondary hypertension.

4. Something notable is the lack of detailed information about the patient's diet and any recent weight changes. These factors can significantly impact blood pressure. Additionally, the patient's current blood pressure reading isn't listed under the "Vital Signs" section. It's crucial to regularly monitor and document this, given the patient's hypertension diagnosis.
