
The diagnosis is correct. However, a lab screening for hyperlipidemia and thyroid studies to assess for thyroid disease would be beneficial, given the patient' details.

In rural areas, the availability of labs may be limited compared to urban hospital settings. However, basic metabolic panels and lipid profiles can be done in some clinics to assess for cardiovascular disease. Any other routine blood test would not be recommended since the patient is not symptomatic.

The dietary advice should be discussed and the patient's dietary habits assessed, with a focus on increasing fruit and vegetables in their diet and reducing salt intake. However, avoiding salt entirely in diet might be difficult and unrealistic for many patients.

To summarize, lifestyle modifications in the form of regular exercise and dietary changes are the recommended therapies for hypertension. Further tests can be considered as part of ongoing management. [2].
[The patient was counseled regarding lifestyle modifications and further tests later if there was any change in his condition or when the results of these tests became available].
