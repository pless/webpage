
This presentation is likely Allergic Conjunctivitis, a common condition particularly among students due to the dust raised by their books and the air in rural schools. Itching and redness are the main presenting symptoms, which are compatible with Allergic Conjunctivitis. If the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, the diagnosis should be re-evaluated. The treatment plan is appropriate for the diagnosing condition. However, to further confirm, more diagnostic tests are required, such as allergen testing in the form of patch tests or prick tests to identify specific allergens. If this is a seasonal problem, the Allergic Conjunctivitis may disappear on its own. However, to prevent further occurrences, allergen avoidance will be essential. Further investigations to identify specific allergens might also be considered in areas with high prevalence of such allergies, for example, pollen allergy tests in local plants. [/instruction] Although this could potentially be Allergic Conjunctivitis, the information given doesn't definitively establish that, given the subjectivity of self-reporting. For Allergic Conjunctivitis, the patient needs to be examined, and visualization needs to be confirmed. The treatment plan is suitable for confirmed Allergic Conjunctivitis, but other options need to be considered, particularly if the patient doesn't display typical signs of the condition. The patient should also undergo allergen tests, including patch tests, prick tests, and IgE tests.
