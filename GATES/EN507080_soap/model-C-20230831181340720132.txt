
 This patient's presentation suggests allergic conjunctivitis, which can be managed with antihistamines. Antiallergic eye drops like antihistamine containing eye drops can be used to reduce allergy symptoms. However, if the symptoms persist longer than three to four days, then a more severe allergic conjunctivitis should be considered, and in such cases, systemic antihistamines may be necessary. The patient should be advised to avoid exposure to allergens and use sunglasses outdoors to reduce exposure to contact allergens.
### Next Action: 
Review the treatment plan, ensure that everything is in order, and update the patient's details. In rural areas, local eye care may be limited, but this patient can be given the necessary information about managing common allergic conjunctivitis by referring them to a specialist eye clinic nearby or in a center city.
