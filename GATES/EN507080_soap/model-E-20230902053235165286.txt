1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Antazoline is an antihistamine used to counteract the effects of histamine in allergic reactions, and it is commonly used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. Cetirizine is also an antihistamine and is used to relieve allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, itching eyes/nose, and sneezing. 

2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Red, itchy eyes are common symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

3. In a rural health clinic, the testing options might be limited. However, the clinical worker could consider a visual acuity test to ensure the child's vision is not affected. Additionally, a detailed history taking can be beneficial to identify any potential allergens in the patient's environment.

4. The only other notable point is that it would be important to educate the child's parents/guardians about reducing exposure to potential allergens, as allergic conjunctivitis is often caused by environmental factors such as dust, pollen, or pet dander. Also, the child should be observed for signs of worsening symptoms or complications such as eye pain, vision changes, or intense redness, as these could indicate a more serious condition requiring immediate medical attention.
