
 Firstly, the treatment plan is consistent with the diagnosis of Impetigo, as the notes indicate that the patient presented with open sores and blisters consistent with Impetigo and that the patient has been undergoing alternate-day dressing. Secondly, the diagnosis of Impetigo appears to be consistent with the patient's presenting symptoms and HPI. Thirdly, while tests would typically include a strep test which is not likely readily available in a rural clinic, additional tests such as a blood culture or chest x-ray might be considered to rule out bacteremia or pneumonia in a severe case but might not be the right course of action here. Fourth, nothing notable stands out. The patient is being managed appropriately.
