
Given this patient's history, it seems that he had malaria (Plasmodium falciparum). The Hb and WBC count were increased for malaria. However, there were no red blood cells observed on microscopic examination of the blood film, which is unusual and suggests that the patient has severe malaria. A malaria parasituria smear should be done to confirm. Further management would include anti-malarial therapy. The patient should be provided with information on preventing future malaria, including the use of anti-malarial drugs for early intervention and protective clothing and insecticides to avoid being bitten again.
Overall, this diagnosis was consistent with the HPI, the systematic review, and the lab results. The patient's previous history of malaria suggested that it was a likelihood. The differential diagnosis was also appropriate. However, there's need for further examination (i.e. microscopy of blood) to confirm the diagnosis. As a clinical health worker, it is important to ensure that patients are followed up after treatment.
