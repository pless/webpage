  Great, thank you for sharing the patient's information with me. Based on the notes you provided, here are my answers to your questions:
1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment plan of prescribing PCM 1g TDS x 3/7 and reviewing the results is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the patient's history of presenting illness (HPI) and physical examination findings are consistent with the diagnosis of malaria. The patient reported a global and dull aching headache, which is a common symptom of malaria. The physical examination findings of a normal temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate, along with the presence of a headache and chills in the evening, also support the diagnosis of malaria.
3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
In a rural health clinic setting, other tests that might be useful in diagnosing malaria include:
* Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria: This is a quick and easy test that can detect malaria parasites in the patient's blood.
* Blood smear examination: This test involves examining a blood sample under a microscope to identify the presence of malaria parasites.
* Urine test: Malaria parasites can be detected in the patient's urine, which can be useful in diagnosing malaria in areas where RDTs and blood smear examinations are not available.
4. Is there anything else notable?
Yes, it is notable that the patient has a history of previous treatment for malaria 7 months ago, but the symptoms have recurred over the last 2 months. This suggests that the patient may have a relapse or recrudescence of malaria, which should be investigated further. Additionally, the patient's reported mild fevers in the evening and abdominal pain may be related to the malaria infection or other underlying conditions, and should be evaluated further during the follow-up appointment.
