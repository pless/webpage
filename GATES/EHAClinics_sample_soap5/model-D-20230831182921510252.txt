
 The treatment is potentially inappropriate given the patient's age. While it is possible that the patient's symptoms are due to malaria, his history of prostate disease along with his known drug allergy to chloroquine make other possibilities more likely. An alternative, and potentially safer, treatment would be chloroquine-proguanil.
There are other infections that could be investigated, such as HIV, if the patient's illness severity warrants further investigation (for example, if there are signs of severe malnutrition or immunodeficiency states), particularly in resource-impaired settings.
It seems unclear whether the patient's symptoms are related to his prostate disease or malaria. Both issues should be explored during the consultation.
The management plan should be regular monitoring for the development of severe malaria, proper antimalarial management, and regular review of potential prostate disease. There is no justifiable reason to investigate HIV here. Referral to any healthcare worker who can provide specialist care or further investigations would be recommended. 

The treatment is potentially inappropriate or unsupported given the patient's age and other factors. Consultation with a specialist (most likely an infectious disease specialist) would be best. The patient should be provided with adequate education and further counseling. Proper education on correct interpretation of malaria symptoms is essential.
