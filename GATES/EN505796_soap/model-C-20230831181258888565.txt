
You appear to have provided a good summary of the situation. However, I think you should be more specific and clear regarding the exact location of this incident. Could you please provide details related to this? This is imperative so that the proper context can be established. 

Additionally, please clarify if there are any specific concerns or additional symptoms that could be relevant to the diagnosis. The patient's age can indicate a respiratory cause. However, it could also be non-specific catarrh not due to an upper respiratory condition. You should check the nose for any signs of an upper respiratory condition like coryza or any other type of catarrh. Additionally, there may be a nasal allergy, or possibly an upper respiratory infection.

To further diagnose, you may want to confirm the diagnosis by assessing the presence of postnasal drip. You can do a simple test for this by pouring a warm saline solution into the nose and observing if the solution is gagged. If it is, it might suggest a postnasal drip. This test is easy to do, straightforward, and non-invasive. Please let me know your findings. Any further investigation would require a referral to a specialist, such as an ear, nose, and throat specialist. 

Please provide relevant information so we can help you better. If you need to refer the patient for specialist examination, please ensure that you have the necessary equipment and resources to do so safely.
