
This patient appears to have conjunctivitis, likely due to allergies and perhaps allergic rhinitis given the chronic conjunctival discharge and ocular pruritis. Based on the patient's history and physical findings, an antiallergic eye drop could be a good starting point. Consider adding antihistamine eye drops in addition if this does not provide relief. If symptoms persist or if the patient reports non-ocular or non-rhinal allergy symptoms, referral to ENT for further evaluation is warranted (like sinusitis).
