  Of course, I'd be happy to help you review the interaction you had with the patient! Here are my answers to your questions:
1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment plan of using antallergic eye drops 4 times daily for 4 weeks is consistent with the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. This medication is commonly used to treat allergic conjunctivitis, which is an inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by an allergic reaction.
2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is consistent with the patient's symptoms of smoky vision on the right eye and oily discharge from the medial canthus. These are common symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.
3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
In a rural health clinic, some additional tests that might be useful in diagnosing allergic conjunctivitis include:
* Skin prick test or blood test to confirm the presence of allergies
* Schirmer's test to assess tear production
* Fluorescein dye test to assess the integrity of the corneal epithelium
* Conjunctival smear for inflammatory cells
* Visual acuity test to assess visual function
4. Is there anything else notable?
Yes, it is notable that the patient's blood pressure was elevated at 180/100 mmHg. Hypertension is a common comorbidity that can affect the eye and may be relevant to the patient's allergic conjunctivitis. It may be worth monitoring the patient's blood pressure and considering antihypertensive medication if it is elevated.
Overall, the diagnosis and treatment plan seem appropriate for the patient's symptoms and are consistent with the information provided in the notes.
