
This patient is likely to have blepharitis, an inflammatory eyelid condition. It is a common disorder, particularly in middle-aged men. It is characterized by symptoms of redness, irritation, and a foreign body sensation in the eyelids. It can also be associated with smoking and oily eyelids. The present plan of antialergic eye drops is likely appropriate. However, this condition sometimes requires two kinds of treatment: one for inflammation and another one for the dryness. In conclusion, I would recommend continued follow-up to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment regimen as necessary. 
The diagnosis and management should focus on the patient's symptoms. The patient should be advised to maintain good hygiene, use soft contact lenses and refrain from smoking and overuse of antibiotics which can cause more harm than good. The patient should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of advanced disease and needs to be vigilant and seek medical help early if any new symptoms develop.
