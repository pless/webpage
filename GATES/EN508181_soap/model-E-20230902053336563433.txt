Firstly, the treatment isn't consistent with the diagnosis because there isn't a specific diagnosis given. The patient has been provided with anti-allergy eye drops, which may suggest that the healthcare worker suspects an allergic reaction. However, this isn't explicitly stated in the diagnosis section.

Secondly, the observations are consistent with several potential diagnoses. The symptoms of smoky vision, oily discharge, itching, redness, and a foreign body sensation could suggest a range of eye conditions including dry eye syndrome, blepharitis, or potentially a more serious condition like glaucoma. 

Thirdly, in a rural health clinic setting, additional tests that could be useful include a visual acuity test to assess the extent of the 'smoky vision', a slit-lamp examination to inspect the eye's anterior segment, and intraocular pressure measurement which could help rule out conditions like glaucoma. An external examination of the eyes, including observation of eyelid health and function, could also be beneficial. 

Fourthly, the patient's high blood pressure is notable. Hypertension can be a risk factor for various eye diseases, including hypertensive retinopathy and glaucoma. This should be addressed and managed appropriately, in conjunction with the patient's primary care physician if possible.
