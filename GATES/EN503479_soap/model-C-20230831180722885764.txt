
The first thing to note is that the diagnosis of chronic headache implies that the patient is not responding to treatment for acute headache, which is a different type of headache. However, chronic tension type headache is a legitimate diagnosis, and with recurrence, it's worth confirming other causes. The treatment is to see a doctor. She needs a physical examination by an expert to confirm the diagnosis, but not a lab test. It would be good to use a headache diary to keep track of the frequency and severity of the headaches. The paracetamol is not necessarily a treatment for chronic headache, and she should consider alternative pain relievers.
