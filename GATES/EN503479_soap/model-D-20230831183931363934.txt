
The patient's symptoms suggest possibly migraine, since the head pain is intermittent and of varying severity, often accompanied by other symptoms such as pallor. However, due to the patient's young age and the severity of her headache over two weeks, a specialist consultation is advised to rule out other causes. The clinical practice guidelines in the National Institute of Health recommend a stepwise approach, starting with simple analgesics and then increasing the management if it doesn't resolve the issue. 

These could include alternative treatments (for example, triptans or ergotamines), or referral to a neurologist specializing in headache disorders. It is also important to address the patient's psychological and social factors since migraine has an impact.
