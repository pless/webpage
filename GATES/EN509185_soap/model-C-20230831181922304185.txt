
Consistency: Your patient is experiencing red eyes after inserting cement into his eye, and he had this diagnosis and treatment last week, which is consistent with the notes provided.

Tests: In some cases, the red eye observed can be normal redness from an injury, or it can be due to a condition like uveitis, iridocyclitis, or scleritis. These conditions often require further tests such as slit-lamp or funduscopic exams, laboratory tests like complete blood count (CBC) and inflammatory markers like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to determine this. These tests are not commonly available in a rural health clinic.

Other notable points include the patient's age. He is young and should be encouraged to follow up to rule out other causes for red eye. It is also good that the patient is using prescribed eye drops. He should also be informed of the dangers of putting anything in the eye.
