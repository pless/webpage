
 This patient presents with features that suggest tension-type headache. The plan of treatment is appropriate, but there does not seem to be an assessment for any potential trigger factors, such as stress or lifestyle factors that might be contributing to her hypertension. The next review should confirm whether the treatment is effective. It would be helpful to consider potential triggers or contributing factors and address them during follow-up visits. [1](McPherson and Pincus). There are limited tests that can be performed in rural health clinics, but it would be reasonable to obtain an ECG and BP assessment. [2-3](O'Reilly). [4] This patient should be enrolled in a hypertension management program and encouraged to adhere to lifestyle modification recommendations, even if those have been in place for some time. More frequent follow-up is also recommended, particularly for patients with severe headache. [5](Waldmann). [6] This patient's plan needs to be reviewed at the end of the three-day course of treatment to assess the efficacy of the medication and determine the need for further management. [7]. [8] There is nothing particularly notable in this interaction. She will need ongoing management of her hypertension, and it would be wise to investigate her history more thoroughly to determine any contributing factors. A health worker should be encouraged to explore other factors that could be contributing to her hypertension, including diet, exercise, and potential lifestyle modifications. [9]. The next review should confirm whether the treatment is effective. [10]. There is no specific issue that requires immediate review. [11](Leung).
