Firstly, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Tension-type headaches can be managed with over-the-counter pain medications such as paracetamol, which is what was prescribed. Adequate rest and sleep are also recommended.

Secondly, the diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the observations. The patient complained of a headache, and tension-type headaches are a common cause of headaches. However, more information about the characteristics of the headache (e.g., location, quality, duration, associated symptoms, triggers) would have been useful to confirm the diagnosis. 

Thirdly, in a rural setting, the tests that could be done include checking the patient's vision, as eye strain from poor vision can cause headaches. Additionally, a basic neurological examination could also be done to rule out other causes of headaches.

Fourthly, it's notable that the patient has a history of hypertension, but her current blood pressure is within normal limits. It's important to ensure her hypertension is well-controlled, as this can also cause or contribute to headaches. A potential point of concern is that if the headache is a new or different symptom for the patient, or if it's significantly more severe or different in character than her usual headaches, this could potentially be a sign of a more serious condition such as a stroke or brain tumor, which would require urgent medical attention. It's important to ask about these things and to advise the patient to seek immediate medical attention if her symptoms change or worsen.
