
 It seems that the diagnosis is likely musculoskeletal pain due to muscle strain (one common cause of general body pain). However, it's important to consider other possibilities until proven otherwise. The patient may be a case of fibromyalgia, particularly if the pain is generalized, persistent, and accompanied by other symptoms such as non-restorative sleep, fatergiveness, irritability, and chronic fatigue. In some cases, patients with fibromyalgia may report sensory symptoms like numbness, tingling, pain with touch or extreme temperatures. You could try ruling out other causes, such as rheumatologic conditions or malignancy, based on clinical assessment. If the pain persists and isn't improving, obtaining imaging (musculoskeletal ultrasound) would be appropriate. In the current case, it's reasonable to manage the symptoms with ibuprofen. The patient should avoid heavy activities and use good posture to take pressure off painful muscles. In addition, stress management techniques (such as stress, physical therapy, or relaxation techniques) would also be helpful. 

Note that in a rural setting, it may not be easy to obtain imaging, especially for malignancy. 

### Next Actions:
Consider referring the patient to a specialist in Musculoskeletal system for further evaluation and advise the patient to be mindful of signs and symptoms that require further evaluation and referral. The patient's other symptoms such as non-restorative sleep, fatigue, should also be managed. The patient should be kept under regular review for clinical progress.
