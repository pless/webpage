This is consistent with catarrh, particularly if it is related to an upper respiratory tract disease. However, It is crucial to perform a full physical examination, and the differential diagnosis should include other upper respiratory tract infections, like acute bronchitis or pneumonia in children. A nasopharyngeal swab for viral PCR may further help to localize the origin of the infection. (Annotated to address the specific question asked)
