
 The patient's symptoms appear to be consistent with acute sinusitis, which is a potentially serious bacterial infection. It is important to consider further diagnostic testing to confirm this diagnosis. The use of Loratadine, an antihistamine, does not make sense in this case. If confirmed, the appropriate treatment would be antibiotics. Depending on local availability, cultures and sensitivities for common bacterial causes of acute sinusitis such as Streptococcus pneumoniae can be obtained. Alternatively, amoxicillin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is a good choice, if readily available at the rural health clinic.

The patient requires close follow-up to confirm improvement and watch for signs of complications. Her symptoms can worsen or she can have other signs of complications. The local healthcare system should inform a more comprehensive management plan.
