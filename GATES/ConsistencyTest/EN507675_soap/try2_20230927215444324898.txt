Without the provided diagnosis and treatment plan, I cannot answer the first two questions accurately. As for the third question, a throat infection could be due to several causes including bacterial (like Streptococcus which causes Strep throat), viral, or even fungal. However, the tests mentioned (Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Urine analysis, Anemia) do not directly relate to diagnosing a throat infection. Lastly, it's notable that the patient's blood pressure is normal but the full physical examination results are not provided, limiting further analysis.
