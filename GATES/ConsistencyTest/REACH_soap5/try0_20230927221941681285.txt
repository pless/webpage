1. The treatment seems more preventive than curative for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Antimalarial drugs would be more appropriate.
2. The diagnosis is not necessarily consistent with the observations, as the symptoms are non-specific and could be due to many other conditions.
3. A Malaria test would be helpful in this case to confirm the diagnosis.
4. Notable is the lack of specific medical, allergy, and family history, which could provide important context for the symptoms and potential diagnosis.
