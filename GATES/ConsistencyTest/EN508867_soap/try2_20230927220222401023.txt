Without the diagnosis and treatment plan, it's impossible to assess if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. There are no tests suggested based on the information given. Notably, the patient's complaints of heartburn and chest pain could indicate a range of issues from gastrointestinal to cardiovascular, but more information is needed to make a judgement.
