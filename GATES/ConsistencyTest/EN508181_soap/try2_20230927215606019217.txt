1. The treatment is not consistent with the diagnosis. There is no specific diagnosis given, and the treatment of antiallergic eye drops does not seem to directly address the symptoms of smoky vision or oily discharge.

2. The diagnosis is not consistent with the observations. The symptoms described could suggest a number of issues such as cataracts, glaucoma, or eye infection, but no specific diagnosis is given.

3. None of the additional tests (Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Urine analysis, Anemia) seem to be directly related to the patient's symptoms.

4. Notable is the patient's high blood pressure, which could potentially be related to the vision issues. The patient may be at risk for hypertension-related complications.
