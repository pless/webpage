The provided note lacks enough information to answer your questions. There is no diagnosis or treatment plan mentioned. Also, given the chief complaint of diarrhoea and abdominal pain, a stool examination might be more beneficial, but it's not listed among the available tests. Please provide more details about the patient's condition, diagnosis, and treatment plan.
