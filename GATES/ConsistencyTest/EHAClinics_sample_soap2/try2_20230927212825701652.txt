1) Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of acute nasopharyngitis. The drugs prescribed are aimed at relieving symptoms of the common cold and supporting immune function.
2) The diagnosis is consistent with the observations; the patient presents with a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and cough - all common symptoms of a cold.
3) None of the additional tests seem necessary based on the information provided. The symptoms align with the common cold and there's no mention of fever or other symptoms that would suggest Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, or Anemia. The lack of dysuria and hematuria also makes a urine analysis unnecessary. 
4) The patient's high BMI is notable. This might suggest a need for lifestyle modification advice to reduce the risk of obesity-related health issues.
