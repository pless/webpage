1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient has been prescribed Duphaston, which is used to prevent miscarriages, and Folic Acid, which is crucial during pregnancy. 

2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has a history of recurrent miscarriages and currently has symptoms of a threatened miscarriage.

3. A urine analysis might be helpful to check for urinary tract infections, which can sometimes cause lower abdominal pain and yellowish discharge.

4. Notable is the history of PID and pregnancy-induced hypertension which may contribute to the patient's recurrent miscarriages. Specialist review and high risk ANC is a good plan.
