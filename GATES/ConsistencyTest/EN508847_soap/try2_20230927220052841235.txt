1. Treatment: The treatment of counselling and referral for specialist review is consistent with the diagnosis of recurrent abortion and ruling out an ectopic pregnancy.
2. Diagnosis: The diagnosis is consistent with the patient's history of multiple miscarriages and symptoms of threatened miscarriage.
3. Additional Tests: A Urine analysis may be helpful to check for infection, given the history of PID and current yellowish discharge. 
4. Notable: The patient has a history of PID and pregnancy-induced hypertension, both of which can increase the risk of miscarriage. These factors should be taken into account in her management.
