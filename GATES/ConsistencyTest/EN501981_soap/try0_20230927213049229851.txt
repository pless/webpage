1. Yes, the treatment of Chlorpheniramine is consistent with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.
2. Yes, the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is consistent with the observations of a runny nose and sneezing.
3. No, none of the additional tests (Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Urine analysis, Anemia) would be helpful in this scenario as the symptoms and diagnosis align with allergic rhinitis which these tests do not help diagnose.
4. Nothing else notable.
