1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Chlopheniramine is a common antihistamine used to treat allergic rhinitis.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The symptoms of a running nose and sneezing are typical of allergic rhinitis.
3. No, none of the additional tests would be helpful. The symptoms and diagnosis do not suggest Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, or Anemia, and a urine analysis is not typically useful for diagnosing allergies.
4. Nothing else notable. The patient's blood pressure is not provided, but this is not typically a significant concern in cases of allergic rhinitis unless the patient has a known history of high blood pressure.
