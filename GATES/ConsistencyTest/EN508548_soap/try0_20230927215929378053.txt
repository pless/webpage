1. The treatment is not clearly tied to a diagnosis as no specific diagnosis is mentioned in the notes. However, the medications prescribed (Norvasc and Accord) are commonly used for hypertension, which is consistent with the high blood pressure reading. Emcap (Paracetamol) is used to manage pain and fever, which could address the headache and general body pain.
 
2. Without a clearly stated diagnosis, it is difficult to say if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's high blood pressure and symptoms of headache and general body pain could suggest a hypertensive crisis, but more information is needed.

3. Given the patient's symptoms and location, a Malaria test could be justified. Headache and general body pain are symptoms of Malaria, which is prevalent in Nigeria. 

4. Notable is the lack of a clear diagnosis in the assessment section. It's also important to note the patient's high blood pressure, which is being treated but may require further monitoring or intervention. The patient's age and symptoms could also suggest other conditions that cannot be tested for at this clinic.
