Without the diagnosis and treatment plan, it's impossible to assess if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. However, given the symptoms of fever and headache, a Malaria test is reasonable. If it's negative, a Typhoid test could be helpful as both diseases present similar symptoms. Other tests aren't strongly indicated based on the information provided.
