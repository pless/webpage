1) The treatment provided, PCM (Paracetamol) for symptom management, is not specific to the diagnosed condition, Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, the patient has a known allergy to Chloroquine, a common anti-malarial medication. This might limit the treatment options. 

2) The diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is consistent with the patient's symptoms of headaches, chills, and mild fevers, especially in the evening.

3) A Malaria test would be helpful as the symptoms and diagnosis suggest malaria, and the results of this test could confirm or refute this diagnosis. 

4) It is notable that the patient has a known allergy to Chloroquine, which may limit treatment options for malaria. Additionally, the patient has a history of Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD), and the symptoms have recurred over the last 2 months. This should also be addressed in the treatment plan.
