1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Antihistamines like chlorpheniramine are often used to treat allergic rhinitis, and paracetamol can help with the fever and pain.

2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Allergic rhinitis can cause symptoms like fever and catarrh.

3. Given the symptoms and diagnosis, none of the additional tests (Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Urine analysis, Anemia) seem necessary at this time.

4. The only notable thing is that the blood pressure is listed as 0/0 mm[Hg], which is likely an error as this is not a possible human blood pressure value.
