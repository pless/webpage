1. The treatment with Amlodipine and Bendroflumethiazide is consistent with the diagnosis of hypertension. However, the patient's other complaints like stiffness of fingers and ankle pain are not directly addressed.
2. The diagnosis of hypertension is consistent with the observations, including the patient's blood pressure reading and her history. The possibility of hypertensive retinopathy fits with her complaint of poor evening vision. 
3. A urine analysis could be beneficial to rule out any kidney issues related to longstanding hypertension. However, none of the other tests (Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Anemia) seem to be necessary based on the current information.
4. The patient's high BMI indicates obesity, which can exacerbate hypertension and contribute to other health problems. It would be beneficial to discuss weight management strategies with the patient.
