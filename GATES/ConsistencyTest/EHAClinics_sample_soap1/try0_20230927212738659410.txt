1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. IV Ceftriaxone is a common treatment for urinary tract infections, and IV Paracetamol can help manage fever and pain.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Fever with chills, lower abdominal pain, back and flank pain, and suprapubic pain suggest urinary tract infection. The negative malaria test and leukocytosis further support this diagnosis.
3. A Malaria test has already been conducted which was negative. Considering the symptoms and the tests already conducted, no additional tests seem necessary.
4. Notable is the patient's known hypertension and allergy to Penicillin. Both of these factors can influence treatment decisions. Also, despite the initial diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the subsequent tests were negative for malaria. This may warrant a review of the initial diagnosis.
