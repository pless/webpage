The information provided is incomplete. The diagnosis and treatment plan are missing. The differential diagnosis is also not provided. Consequently, it's impossible to determine if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Additional tests like Urine analysis could be helpful considering the lower abdominal pain, but without more information, it's difficult to suggest further. Also, it's unclear if any other notable issues are present due to the lack of information.
