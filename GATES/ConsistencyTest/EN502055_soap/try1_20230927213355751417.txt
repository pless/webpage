No treatment or diagnosis is provided in the note. It's impossible to determine if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's symptoms could suggest Malaria or Typhoid, so testing for these could be helpful. The patient's amenorrhea could indicate pregnancy; consider if a pregnancy test is available. The note lacks a coherent assessment and plan; this is notable and should be addressed.
