This note is missing a lot of information. There is no stated diagnosis, differential diagnosis, or treatment plan. Therefore, I can't answer your questions about the consistency of the treatment with the diagnosis or whether the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The symptoms mentioned (cattarh, headache, cough) could indicate a variety of conditions, so without further information, I can't recommend any specific tests. There's nothing else notable because there's not enough information to make any assessments.
