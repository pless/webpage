The information provided is not sufficient to answer your questions. The diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment plan sections are not filled out, so it's impossible to determine if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Similarly, without a diagnosis or symptoms, it's impossible to determine which, if any, of the additional tests would be helpful. Finally, without more information, there are no other notable aspects to comment on.
