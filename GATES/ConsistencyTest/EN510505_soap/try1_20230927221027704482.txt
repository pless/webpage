1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The use of ibuprofen and paracetamol for pain and inflammation, and amoxicillin for possible bacterial infection is appropriate.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The symptoms of gum itching and mild swelling could be due to a dental infection.
