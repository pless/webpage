1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The prescribed ibuprofen and paracetamol will help to manage pain and inflammation, while the amoxicillin will treat any potential bacterial infection causing the gum swelling.

3. In this case, additional tests for Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, or Anemia may not be necessary. The symptoms seem to be localized to the gums and there is no indication of systemic illness.

4. The child's BMI is significantly high, indicating possible obesity. This could have implications for overall health and may need to be addressed in future consultations.
