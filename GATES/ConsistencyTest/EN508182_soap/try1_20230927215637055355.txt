1. The treatment (referral for low vision aid) is consistent with the patient's complaint of poor vision, but not linked to a specific diagnosis.
2. The diagnosis isn't clear. The patient's history of fever and convulsions in childhood could be relevant, but it's not clear how it relates to current vision problems.
3. A malaria test could be considered since he had a history of fever with convulsions, which could be symptoms of severe malaria in children. However, it is less likely if those symptoms are not currently present.
4. Notable is the lack of a clear diagnosis and the limited information available. A more comprehensive patient history and a complete eye examination could potentially be helpful for diagnosis.
