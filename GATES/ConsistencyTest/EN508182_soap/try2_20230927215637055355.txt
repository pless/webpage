1. The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient was referred for low vision aid which is appropriate for his chief complaint of poor vision.
2. The diagnosis is not clearly stated, making it difficult to assess consistency with the observations. However, the patient's history of fever with convulsions in childhood could be relevant.
3. A Malaria test could be helpful given the patient's history of fever with convulsions. This could help rule out any long-term effects of a previous malaria infection.
4. Notable is the lack of a clear diagnosis and differential diagnoses. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible neurological issue, which would be difficult to diagnose and treat in a resource-limited setting.
