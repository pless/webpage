1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of Tinea corporis and nonspecific skin eruption. Erythromycin is an antibiotic used for bacterial infections, Hydrocortisone cream is used for inflammation and itching, and Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine for allergic reactions.

2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observed skin rashes.
