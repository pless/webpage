1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension. 
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations as the patient has a known history of hypertension and the blood pressure reading is above normal. 
3. None of the additional tests would be particularly helpful based on the information provided. The condition seems to be well-managed with medication and no additional symptoms are noted.
4. Notable is that the patient is prescribed 28 tablets for 14 days, indicating a twice daily dose, but the treatment plan suggests only once a day dosage. This discrepancy should be clarified.
