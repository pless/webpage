1. Treatment consistency: Without a definite diagnosis, it's hard to tell if the treatment is consistent. However, Buscopan is commonly used for stomach pain, so it seems reasonable.

2. Diagnosis consistency: Again, without a clear diagnosis, it's difficult to say if the observations match. A stomachache could be a symptom of many conditions.

3. Additional tests: A urine analysis could be useful to rule out urinary tract infections, which can cause abdominal pain. 

4. Notable items: A differential diagnosis is missing. This is significant, as a stomachache is a common symptom for numerous conditions. The patient's history, other symptoms, and physical exam findings should be used to narrow down potential diagnoses.
