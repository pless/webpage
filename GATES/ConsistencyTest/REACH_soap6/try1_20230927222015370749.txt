1. The treatment is not entirely consistent with the diagnosis. While a healthy diet, avoiding pollutants, and minimizing contact with sick individuals is good general advice, it may not directly address the diagnosed cough. 

2. The diagnosis is not entirely consistent with the observations. The patient's chief complaint was a cold and headache, but the diagnosis is cough, which was not part of the complaint.

3. Considering the symptoms and limited resources, a Malaria test might be helpful given the symptoms of fever and headache. 

4. The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side. Also, there's a lack of detailed examination findings and patient history that could be helpful in diagnosis and treatment.
