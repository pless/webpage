1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient is being treated for pain with an anti-inflammatory (Diclofenac) and a pain relief gel.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient has pain on the right side of the chest that was aggravated by deep breathing and relieved by Diclofenac. No other symptoms were reported. 
3. None of the additional tests seem necessary based on the presented symptoms. The patient's pain seems musculoskeletal in nature, not indicative of Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, or Anemia. A urine analysis could potentially reveal an underlying condition, but there's no strong reason to suggest it.
4. Notable is the patient's smoking habit, which could be contributing to his chest pain. The advice given to quit smoking is important.
