Without the diagnosis and treatment plan information, it is impossible to provide a review on whether the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. Additionally, without knowing the diagnosis, it's not possible to suggest if any of the additional tests would be beneficial. Please provide more information.
