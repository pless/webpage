As the note is incomplete, it's not possible to fully assess the diagnosis, treatment, and whether additional tests would be helpful. The diagnosis and treatment are not provided. Given the patient's fever and headache, malaria seems a likely consideration, but more information is needed. The Malaria Parasite - RDT test has been done, but the result isn't stated. No other tests are suggested at this point due to insufficient information. The note lacks a lot of necessary detail for a comprehensive review.
