Since there is no given diagnosis or treatment plan, I cannot answer the first two questions. 

For the third question, given the symptoms of fever, headache, and vomiting, and the patient's general pale appearance, a Malaria test could be beneficial since these are common symptoms of Malaria, especially in Nigeria. 

The fourth question cannot be answered as well due to the lack of information.
