1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Ibuprofen can help alleviate pain and inflammation associated with Acute serous otitis media.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The symptoms of ear pain and discharge, along with the physical examination findings, support the diagnosis of Acute serous otitis media.
3. No additional tests are needed. The symptoms and physical exam findings are clear and do not indicate any of the diseases that the other tests would detect.
4. Notable: There is a discrepancy in the note where it states there is no ear discharge under HPI, but under the physical exam, it notes discharge in both ears. This should be clarified.
