1. The treatment is not consistent with the diagnosis. Plasmodium falciparum malaria requires antimalarial medication, not just advice on personal hygiene, drinking water, and use of a mosquito net. 

2. The diagnosis is somewhat consistent with the observations. Fever and headache are common symptoms of malaria, but some key symptoms like joint pain and chills are missing.

3. A Malaria test would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other diseases.

4. Notable is the high blood pressure reading (223/75), which is dangerously high and may indicate a separate medical issue that needs immediate attention.
