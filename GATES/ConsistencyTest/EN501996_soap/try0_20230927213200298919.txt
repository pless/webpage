2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations of a headache and patient history of hypertension.
3. No, none of the additional tests (Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Urine analysis, Anemia) seem necessary based on the presented symptoms and diagnosis.
4. Notable is that the patient's blood pressure is currently within a normal range, despite a history of hypertension. It would be important to continue monitoring this.
