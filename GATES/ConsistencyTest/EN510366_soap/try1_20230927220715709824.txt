1. The treatment with artemether-lumefantrine and paracetamol is consistent with the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
2. The diagnosis of malaria is consistent with the presented symptoms of fever, dizziness, and headache.
3. Given the symptoms and diagnosis, a Malaria test would be the most relevant and it has already been done. No other tests seem strongly indicated based on the current information.
4. Notable is the high blood pressure reading of 130/97 mmHg, which might require monitoring or treatment if persistently high.
