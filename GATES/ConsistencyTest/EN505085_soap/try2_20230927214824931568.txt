Without any specific diagnosis or treatment plan listed, I am unable to answer your questions regarding consistency of treatment with diagnosis, or diagnosis with observations. Additional tests might be helpful based on the patient's symptoms - a urine analysis could help identify a possible urinary tract infection or kidney issue, which can sometimes present with abdominal pain. Without more information, it's hard to make any other notable comments.
