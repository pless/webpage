The information provided is incomplete. Diagnosis and treatment plan are missing. Additionally, no symptoms or clinical signs are mentioned that would suggest a peptic ulcer. Therefore, it's not possible to assess if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. There's also insufficient information to determine if any of the additional tests would be helpful. Please provide more information.
