1. Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. The patient is diagnosed with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and the treatment includes Omeprazole and Mg Trisilicate tablets, both of which are used to manage GERD.
2. Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's symptoms of hypersalivation, nausea, and vomiting can be associated with GERD.
3. An H. Pylori test has been suggested, which is appropriate for the diagnosis of GERD. None of the additional tests (Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Urine analysis, Anemia) seem strongly indicated based on the current symptoms.
4. Notable is the patient's ongoing use of Diclofenac, which could potentially exacerbate GERD symptoms. The doctor has appropriately advised to stop this medication. Also, the patient's known diabetes and hypertension should continue to be managed.
