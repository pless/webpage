1. The treatment plan is consistent with the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The plan includes the prescription of Omeprazole, a medication used to reduce stomach acid and treat GERD.
2. The diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, hypersalivation, and cold sensation under the feet could be associated with GERD.
3. None of the additional tests seem necessary based on the given information. The symptoms presented and the diagnosis do not strongly indicate Malaria, Typhoid, HIV, Hepatitis, Anemia, or the need for a Urine analysis.
4. It's notable that the patient is a known hypertensive and diabetic, and that the patient is taking Diclofenac daily, which has been stopped due to its potential to worsen GERD symptoms. The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, which should be monitored given her known hypertension.
