
In this patient, the headache and epigastric pain suggest the possibility of migraine or a gastrointestinal issue. However, both her age and the short duration of these symptoms make a more serious cause unlikely. Further tests might not be available except for laboratory tests that require referral to a diagnostic center. For now, the patient should be reassured that these symptoms will not cause serious harm, counselled on how to better manage her migraine or GI issues, and referred to a specialist if she is still experiencing these symptoms after six months. A fall risk assessment should be carried out to ensure she takes measures to prevent falls. However, if she is still using any potentially harmful method, it is imperative she switch to safer alternatives.
