Based on the information provided, it's impossible to answer the questions. The diagnosis and treatment plan fields are empty, making it impossible to determine if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, or if the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. 

For further tests, considering the symptoms of headache and epigastric pain, I would suggest a complete blood count (CBC) to check for infections, anemia, or other blood disorders that might cause these symptoms. If available, an abdominal ultrasound could be performed to rule out any gallbladder or stomach issues that might cause epigastric pain. A simple urine test could also be helpful to check for urinary tract infection or kidney issues. 

As for anything else notable, it would be important to know more about the nature, duration, and severity of the headache and epigastric pain. Additionally, information such as any associated symptoms, past medical history, or family history of similar symptoms would be helpful in making an accurate diagnosis.
