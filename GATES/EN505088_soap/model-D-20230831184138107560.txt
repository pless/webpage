
The diagnosis seems to be angina pectoris based on the patient's history of chest pain. Her pain seems worse than normal because of her age and medical history. It may be worth reassessing the pain score; the initial score of 4 is a little high. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease should be assessed as part of the routine assessment. If there is a concern about the risk of myocardial infarction, then an ECG, troponin, or blood tests for cardiac risk factors could be considered. If she has a history of angina without any structural heart disease, then lifestyle interventions such as smoking cessation, weight loss, and regular exercise would be appropriate; medication such as an ACE inhibitor, Beta blocker, or antiplatelet agent could also be considered. There is also the possibility of a cardiac cause for her symptoms (like a myocardial infarction), which needs to be considered, especially given her history of vascular disease. To rule that out, then a higher level of investigation including blood work, ECG, and possibly an echocardiogram would be needed. 

This particular patient would be high risk, and an assessment of her risk for myocardial infarction should be made based on the results. Given her age and risk factors, management should be tailored to the potential of cardiovascular disease and subsequent myocardial infarction. Given her history of smoking, she should be referred for smoking cessation. Regular reassessment would be necessary. [1,2]
