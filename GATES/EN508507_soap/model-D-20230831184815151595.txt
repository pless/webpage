
The patient's pain in the chest is concerning for angina, despite having DM and HTN managed well. The patient should be encouraged to see the cardiologist for this as soon as possible. [Hypertension and Diabetes aren't necessarily contributing causes for chest pain] [The pain scale is not clearly reported.] [Based on the patient's BP control, it suggests there is a need for other management options.].
