
 1. This patient is not experiencing hypertensive crisis because his blood pressure is not in the hypertensive range. His BP is consistently high, but not a cause for concern. One potential consideration which may need further assessment is drug-induced hypertension from his medications, either due to non-compliance or adverse effects.
2. Given the patient's history of hypertension, current findings of uncontrolled hypertension, and his age, there is no need for further evaluation given the known patient characteristics. However, if there is the suspicion of white coat hypertension, it's important to take into account the other co-morbidities.
3. Depending on the clinical scenario, a quick blood sugar test or measurement of the patient's renal function could be useful for ruling out other secondary causes of hypertension. However, these tests may be difficult to perform in a rural health clinic.
4. There is no obvious indication for referral, given his known history and the current findings. However, it is important to continue monitoring for control of his hypertension. His known DM must also be actively managed simultaneously. [/] Although the patient's BP is consistently high, this is not a cause for concern, and the issue is not an immediate emergency. Further assessment may be necessary to rule out potential causes of hypertension, such as drug-induced hypertension potentially caused by non-compliance or adverse effects. The patient's known Hypertension, current findings of uncontrolled hypertension, and his age create the clinical picture, and a white coat effect may be a concern. While possible, given the known patient characteristics, the other co-morbidities need to be considered. The clinic, in this case, should not refer the patient. Instead, the patient's known hypertension and DM must be actively managed. The patient should be routinely monitored.
