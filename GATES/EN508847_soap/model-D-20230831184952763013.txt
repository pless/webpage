
The patient seems to be presenting with a case of recurrent miscarriage which is associated with risk factors of primary infertility, young age, history of abortion and PID. This might be a red flag for a serious underlying cause which warrants further investigation particularly given her history. The presence of mild right-sided abdominal pain, and yellowish PV discharge might suggest an ectopic pregnancy. However, this shouldn't be immediately ruled out without further investigation, including abdominal US and possibly HCG and serum B-hCG levels. If confirmed, management would involve surgical intervention.

Other potential causes could be an infection in the genital tract, cervix or the fallopian tube. It is important to consider this in the differential diagnosis given these risk factors and also to screen for same in her sexual partners. The primary care physician should review her medication chart for any evidence of side effects from her current treatment. This review should also include the patient's social support system.

In summary, this patient's history, findings on examination, and current symptoms might be suggestive of a more serious underlying condition. She should be referred to a specialist for further review, as this case requires a more detailed assessment and appropriate management.
