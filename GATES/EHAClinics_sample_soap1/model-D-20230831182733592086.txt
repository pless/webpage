
This patient appears to be suffering from malaria and urinary tract infection. The leukocytosis and lymphopenia suggest that there might be a systemic inflammatory response, possibly due to the infection. The hypertensive patient known to be compliant with good BP control, not a known diabetic, asthmatic, or seizure disorder patient. No other tests will be necessary in a rural health clinic. She should be admitted for the management of her illness.

Please note that since she is a known hypertensive, the management plan should consider her BP control, antihypertensive medication side effects, and adjust the therapy if needed. In case she's admitted, we should monitor her BP and BP control closely. 

I would recommend continuing her current anti-malarial regimen for five days and follow up with blood work to see how her infection is progressing. 

Ideally, her clinical course should be monitored with her caregivers to follow up on her improvement.
