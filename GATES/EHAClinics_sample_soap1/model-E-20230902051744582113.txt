1. Is the treatment consistent with the diagnosis?
Yes, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. IV Ceftriaxone is used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs). IV Paracetamol is used to relieve pain and reduce fever, which are symptoms of both Plasmodium falciparum malaria and UTIs. 

2. Is the diagnosis consistent with the observations?
Yes, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The symptoms of high-grade fever, chills, and rigors can be associated with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The symptoms of lower back pain, flank pain, and suprapubic pain can be associated with a UTI.

3. Are there other things you would test, but only tests that might be available in rural health clinics?
Given the patient's symptoms and the tests already completed, a test for kidney function could be considered. This could be done through a basic metabolic panel, which tests for creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, two waste products that kidneys should remove from the blood. If these levels are high, it could suggest a kidney issue. 

4. Is there anything else notable?
The patient's hypertension and BMI of 29.4 (which is in the overweight range, nearing obesity) are notable. Both of these factors can contribute to health complications, including UTIs. It's also notable that the patient is allergic to penicillin, which is a common antibiotic, as this could limit treatment options for bacterial infections. The patient's negative malaria parasite test is also notable, as it suggests that the malaria diagnosis may need to be reconsidered.
