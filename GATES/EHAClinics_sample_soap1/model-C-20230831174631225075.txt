Given the low back pain, a differential diagnosis of pyelonephritis is also possible. Given the patient's history of regular menstrual cycles, there's no reason to suspect pregnancy. There aren't any other conditions that could possibly present with similar symptoms. Other tests that might be available in a rural health clinic would include blood culture for the malaria diagnosis. Lab tests for renal function, including urinalysis, and blood culture are important for ruling out other conditions. The patient would benefit from further observation of her condition, especially given the recent vomiting and fever. For the lower back pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be sufficient for relieving the pain initially, but other options could be explored. It is important to monitor her vitals, especially her blood pressure and respiratory rate, closely. She may need hospital admission for further management.
