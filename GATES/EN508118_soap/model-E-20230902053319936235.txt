Based on the information given:

1. The treatment seems consistent with the diagnosis, although the diagnosis is not explicitly stated. The patient has a high blood pressure reading (145/90 mm[Hg]), and Nifedipine is a medication typically used to treat high blood pressure. Additionally, paracetamol is a common medication used to alleviate headaches.

2. The diagnosis is not explicitly stated, but if it were hypertension, it would be consistent with the observation of high blood pressure. However, a one-off high blood pressure reading does not necessarily indicate hypertension. It requires consistent high readings over time. Additionally, the headache could be a symptom of high blood pressure, but it could also be related to many other conditions.

3. Given the resources typically available in rural health clinics, I would suggest additional tests such as repeated blood pressure readings over time to confirm or rule out hypertension. A complete blood count (CBC) could be helpful to rule out infection or anemia which could also cause headaches. Urinalysis might be useful to check kidney function, as kidney issues can cause high blood pressure. 

4. Notable is the young age of the patient with a high blood pressure reading. It would be important to investigate further, as hypertension is less common in young adults. Also, it's worth noting that the headache has persisted for 5 days, which is relatively long for a simple tension headache or similar. This could indicate a more serious underlying condition, and further investigation would be warranted.
