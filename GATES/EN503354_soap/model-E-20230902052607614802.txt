Based on the information provided, it's difficult to provide a complete review as there are missing details. For instance, the diagnosis and the treatment plan are not mentioned. However, I'll try to give some insights based on the available information.

1. The treatment is not mentioned, so I cannot comment on whether it is consistent with the diagnosis.

2. The diagnosis is not provided, so I cannot comment on whether it is consistent with the observations. However, the symptoms of fever and headache could indicate a variety of conditions, including infections, flu, or other diseases, which would need to be diagnosed through further testing.

3. In a rural health clinic, with the symptoms presented, I would consider tests for common diseases in the region. For instance, if the patient is from a region where dengue or zika is prevalent, a test for these diseases might be considered. Other tests could include complete blood count, urinalysis, or a rapid influenza diagnostic test if it's flu season. 

4. It's notable that the patient has a fever and headache for 3 days, which could indicate a more serious condition that needs immediate attention. It's also worth noting that the patient's blood pressure is on the lower end of normal, which could be related to the illness or could indicate a separate issue. However, without more information, it's difficult to provide a more comprehensive review. Please provide the diagnosis and treatment plan for a more complete review.
