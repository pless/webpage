
The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of malaria. However, the diagnostic test was not done in-clinic, but via an RDT. This is a suitable diagnostic test because it is easy to use and can produce results in a matter of minutes. It would be ideal to get the results within 15 minutes.
There could be other causes of fever requiring antimalarial medication, such as scrub typhus (bush typhus). Given the rural setting, a malaria rapid diagnostic test would be appropriate even though the patient reports being away for a week without symptoms. The WHO recommends testing for malaria in any patient presenting with fever in an endemic area, regardless of duration of symptoms. Furthermore, if there is a risk of severe malaria, such as cerebral malaria, it is important to get the result as quickly as possible because timely treatment significantly improves outcomes.
Other tests that could be considered are blood examination to check for peripheral blood smear and to confirm the cause of the fever. However, in a resource-poor setting, these tests may not be available.
Given the patient's symptoms, the treatment plan for severe malaria (as defined by WHO) is warranted, given the risk for severe malaria, such as cerebral malaria and multi-organ failure, which can occur in seconds to minutes without prompt treatment. The patient should be closely monitored, and other symptoms should be looked out for, such as fever, headache, abdominal pain, or nausea. The patient should be kept hydrated to minimize the risk of severe malaria.
If severe malaria were suspected and not confirmed by a positive rapid diagnostic test, other severe malaria-indicators, such as a serious illness, loss of consciousness, difficulty breathing, or other signs of severe organ dysfunction, could warrant the use of a blood test to confirm the diagnosis. (Reference to malaria management guidelines recommended by WHO).

Therefore, a malaria rapid diagnostic test should be done at an appropriate laboratory, and appropriate antimalarials should be administered. Regular monitoring of the patient, including continued vital sign assessment and symptoms check, and close cooperation with a physician or any other medical professional, is necessary until the patient recovers fully, which could be a few days or sometimes a few weeks.
Note: Given the risk of severe malaria, the management should be close to a referral hospital, with easy transportation means and a clinician with malaria case management skills.
