The parent's observation of redness on the side of the face and the child's recent cold-like symptoms are also consistent with this diagnosis. The absence of other systemic findings would also support this diagnosis. Given serous otitis media is an acute illness, the patient would be seen again in seven days and would not have any other testing done in rural health clinics though a complete blood count could be helpful for general wellness, which the mother could potentially take care of.
