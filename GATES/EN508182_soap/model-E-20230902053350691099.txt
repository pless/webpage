Based on the information provided:

1. The treatment is not necessarily inconsistent with the diagnosis, but the diagnosis is not clearly stated. The child was referred for low vision aid, which is appropriate if the child has a vision problem. However, the actual cause of the vision problem is not identified in the notes.

2. The diagnosis is not consistent with the observations because there is no specific diagnosis stated. The chief complaint is poor vision in both eyes, but the diagnosis section only states "Others," which does not provide enough information to determine if it is consistent with the observations.

3. In a rural health clinic, basic vision tests can be done to identify the source of the vision problem. This could include a visual acuity test, a color vision test, or a cover test to see how well the eyes work together. It might also be worthwhile to look into the patient's history of fever with convulsions in childhood, as certain illnesses can potentially cause vision problems.

4. What is notable is the lack of a specific diagnosis and the lack of clear description of the physical examination. A complete physical examination is mentioned, but no details are provided about the findings. Additionally, the history of fever with convulsions in childhood is significant and could be related to the present vision problem. This should be investigated further.
