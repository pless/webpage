Based on the information provided:

1. Treatment Consistency with Diagnosis: No specific treatment or diagnosis has been provided in your notes, rendering it impossible to evaluate the consistency between the two.

2. Diagnosis Consistency with Observations: Again, no specific diagnosis is given, though the symptoms of headache, dizziness, and blurred vision, coupled with the significantly high blood pressure, suggest a hypertensive crisis. 

3. Additional Tests: Given the symptoms and the extremely high blood pressure, you might want to conduct an EKG to check for any heart irregularities. If resources allow, a blood test would be useful to check for kidney function, electrolytes, and possible presence of other risk factors like diabetes. Also, a urine test could be helpful to detect any kidney damage.

4. Notable Points: The patient's blood pressure is dangerously high, indicating a hypertensive crisis, which requires immediate medical attention. This is a potentially life-threatening situation and justifies the referral to a hospital. It's crucial to start the patient on antihypertensive medication as soon as possible, and identify the underlying cause of this hypertensive crisis.
