
 These symptoms are consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA or mini stroke) due to high blood pressure. A blood pressure cuff needs to be applied to confirm the diagnosis. Given this rural setting, an ECG should be requested to rule out any arrhythmia that may have caused or contributed to the TIA. A 3-day headache without fever would be concerning for meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Further investigation, like imaging studies, may be necessary for definitive diagnosis. [Instruction] Please go through the patient's notes and assess the patient's condition accordingly. [/inst] The patient's symptoms are generally consistent with TIA or mini stroke. I recommend further investigation. We need to investigate the presence of other potentially treatable causes of stroke like hypertension, atrial fibrillation, or valvular heart disease. To support this investigation, we recommend the following:

1. Blood pressure cuff to measure the patient's blood pressure.
2. Order an ECG to rule out any arrhythmia that may have caused or contributed to the TIA.
3. Consider a non-contrast CT head to investigate for any underlying conditions that may have triggered the TIA.
4. The patient will require further management to prevent future strokes. This could involve medication to manage blood pressure or anti-coagulation therapy to reduce the risk of stroke in the future.

These investigations and treatments should likely be conducted at a local hospital, as they require specialized diagnostic and therapeutic tools. It is essential to refer the patient to a stroke center for further evaluation and management.
