
This is suspected malaria, as it occurs in a 19-year-old female patient in rural areas with fever and chills, as well as body aches and headache. She is restless and has a high fever. Blood tests should be performed for confirmation. In this setting, a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is reasonable. The next action would be to confirm the results by using a microscopic analysis. As a rural health worker, it might not be possible to perform microscopic analysis, and immediate confirmatory treatment should be given based on the positive RDT result. 
The next step may include the patient's management, education, follow-up examination, and investigation, where relevant. 

I hope this was helpful!
