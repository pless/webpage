However, you may also want to consider other causes of fever, especially if the patient is in an area with other endemic diseases like meningitis, typhoid fever, or tuberculosis. If the test results are inconclusive or there are signs of increased inflammatory response, further investigation is necessary. Rapid diagnostic tests are available in many rural areas in developing countries. If the test is inconclusive, you can perform a complete blood count (CBC) to assess the extent of infection, and if the patient has symptoms of cerebral malaria, a lumbar puncture could be considered. (Clinical assessment would be essential.)

Overall, this seems to be a consistent and appropriate diagnosis based on the symptoms and test results.
