
 This patient presents with a patient with a potentially life-threatening infection, such as catarrh of unknown origin, which would require broad-spectrum antibiotics and close monitoring. Further tests such as blood culture or throat swab culture should be used to determine bacterial or viral cause of this infection. However, it is important to note that it may not be feasible to do this in a rural setting due to limited resources and accessibility. The patient must be closely managed, and sputum culture result reported. The patient should start on intravenous [a broad-spectrum antibiotic] immediately and be closely observed and managed until culture results are available. [If bacterial, broad-spectrum coverage would be needed until the local bacterial resistance pattern is determined]. In some tropical areas there are specific bacterial strains that are susceptible to specific antibiotics. The patient's general condition and vital signs should be closely monitored for signs of deterioration and management plan adjusted accordingly. [For example, signs of sepsis include but are not limited to fever>38%, tachycardia, tachypnea/rapid breathing, RR >20/20, altered mental status, or changes in MAP with systolic blood pressure <90].] [This patient is at risk for a serious complications, including the potential for rapid deterioration and potentially septic shock, particularly in the current context of an HIV patient]. [If the patient's conditions deteriorates [or the patient has features of severe illness], immediate [intravenous] broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given]. [Emergency care including the possibility of ICU admission, may be necessary for close management of this patient.].
