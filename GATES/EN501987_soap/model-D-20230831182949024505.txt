
This case doesn't seem to have an issue as the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. However, we should consider testing the patient for other related conditions such as asthma due to her history. Even in a rural area, relevant tests could include a chest X-ray, spirometry to assess lung function, skin prick test for other allergens, and possibly an allergy skin prick test if any of the patient's allergens can be obtained locally. 
It is important to regularly assess the patient's response to the current treatment. Is there anything else that could be done to help this patient? [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [7].
