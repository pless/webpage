
The treatment prescribed for the patient appears appropriate based on the diagnosis of Allergic Rhinitis. It is important to note that this is a chronic condition, so she may need ongoing therapy. If she develops other symptoms (e.g., sinusitis), other tests might be warranted. In a rural setting, other testing might include obtaining a nasal swab for bacterial culture. It's also important to regularly review the regimen with the patient and adjust as needed.

The fact that the patient is a fall risk is an issue that needs to be addressed, but in a rural setting, it might require special transportation or home assessment. It might also be important to check her blood pressure regularly in follow-up appointments.

A follow-up appointment should be arranged for at least 24 hours after the medication has started to assess the response to treatment and check for any signs of worsening symptoms, adverse drug reactions, or the possibility of developing a sinus infection.
