First, the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis. Allergic rhinitis is often treated with antihistamines such as cetirizine (Zirtek) to reduce symptoms like catarrh and coughing. Paracetamol is given for pain relief, which is appropriate due to the patient's reported head pain. Vitamin C is often used to boost the immune system and may help with the patient's overall symptoms.

Second, the diagnosis is consistent with the observations. The patient's symptoms of fever, catarrh and coughing could indicate allergic rhinitis. However, the presence of fever is not typical for allergic rhinitis and could suggest a possible infection.

Third, considering the limited resources in a rural health clinic, a complete blood count (CBC) could be done to check for signs of infection given the presence of fever. Additionally, allergy testing could be performed if available to confirm the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. 

Fourth, the patient's high blood pressure is notable. Although it is not extremely high, it is on the higher end of the scale and should be monitored. It could be related to the patient's current illness, but if it persists once the patient is feeling better, it may indicate an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.
