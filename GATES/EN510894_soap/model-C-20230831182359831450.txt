
 Consistency of treatment and diagnosis: Yes. It is a treatment based on the diagnosis of gastritis. This diagnosis seems appropriate based on the HPI, history of abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. It's important to note that the patient's BMI suggests a risk factor for chronic non-communicable diseases like diabetes. Other tests could include serum bilirubin, amylase, and lipase to assess pancreatic function and a fecal occult blood test, hemoglobin A1c to assess glucose control, and thyroid function tests but only if there are any specific symptoms. Note that there are local healthcare concerns as this patient may not be easily able to access these medications. Further assessment and follow-up should be done.
