
 The treatment is consistent with the diagnosis, which is an acute case of tonsillitis. In acute tonsillitis, antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat secondary bacterial infections, not the primary bacterial infection. Therefore, it's unnecessary in this case.
While tonsillitis is often associated with fever, it doesn't always present that way. Fever may decrease with the commencement of antibiotic treatment, rather than before treatment. So, it might be useful to check the patient's temperature.
Though this patient was treated with amoxicillin for five days and antipyretics for three days, there's still the possibility of developing complications which can present differently. The common serious complications of tonsillitis include posterior pharyngeal abscess, which shows no symptoms initially but presents like a severe viral infection, and Quinsy. Both of these should be included in the differential diagnosis especially when treatment doesn't work. The presence of risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and a history of similar illnesses puts the patient at a higher risk of future abscesses. Therefore, the patient will need frequent evaluations and follow-ups.
### Final Consideration: Note that the patient was prescribed antibiotics at the onset, but it can be an appropriate choice because the patient showed no other signs apart from the main complaint and history. However, future cases or complications should include this diagnosis.
The patient is also advised to get rest, drink fluids, and to gargle with warm honey water frequently to relieve some of their symptoms.
Lastly, encourage the patient to present promptly for any emergence of new symptoms or worsening of complaints.
