Based on the information provided:

1. Treatment Consistency with Diagnosis: It is difficult to determine if the treatment is consistent with the diagnosis as no specific diagnosis is provided in the notes. However, Dolo-Meta B is commonly used for the relief of pain and inflammation, which could be consistent with the patient's complaint of lower back pain.

2. Diagnosis Consistency with Observations: Again, there is no specific diagnosis provided. The patient's complaint of lower back pain is a symptom that could be associated with a range of conditions, from muscular strain to kidney problems. More information would be needed to make a specific diagnosis.

3. Other Tests: In a rural health clinic, a basic urine test could be done to rule out kidney issues. If the pain is related to a muscle strain or similar issue, the physical examination should include palpation of the affected area, assessment of range of motion, and possibly simple tests of muscle strength and reflexes. If the patient has any risk factors for conditions like osteoporosis or arthritis (such as family history or specific lifestyle factors), these could also be considered, although testing for these might be limited in a rural setting.

4. Notable Observations: The patient's blood pressure is in the normal range, and she appears to be in a comfortable state and in good health apart from the reported back pain. It is notable that there is no information on any potential causes or exacerbating factors for the pain, such as injury, heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, etc. Additionally, there is no mention of whether the pain is constant or intermittent, or if it's associated with any other symptoms. This information could be helpful in making a more specific diagnosis.
