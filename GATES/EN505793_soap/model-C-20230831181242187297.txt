
 The patient complains of back pain and presents a chronic, non-specific condition like lower back pain, possibly a musculoskeletal condition. However, it is possible it could be related to other conditions. A differential diagnosis should be considered including soft tissue or joint issues. If this is a non-specific back pain, it is important to investigate how to manage it. The patient may also require physical rehabilitation, physical exercise or other management techniques. The patient has been prescribed Diclofenac and Vitamin B supplement, these are commonly used, but ensure that it is the appropriate dose, and the patient is aware of side effects. Additional tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Consider ordering an X-ray or MRI to confirm the diagnosis. The patient has been advised to follow-up for subsequent assessment, depending on the outcome of the investigation.
