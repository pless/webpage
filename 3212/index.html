<h3>CSCI 3212, Fall 2020 Edition</h3>

Hello!  Welcome to the Fall 2020 edition of the Algorithms course.  I
am substituting for Rahul Simha this semester while he is on
sabbatical.  I very much look forward to teaching this course.

<h5>Course Structure:</h5>

Like all undergraduate courses for the Fall of 2020, this course will
be held online.  The course will meet Tuesday and Thursday from 11:10
-- 12:25.

<h5>Textbook:</h5>
The course will follow the following amazing, free, online textbook:

<a href="http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/">Algorithms, by Jeff Erickson</a>.  You are explicitly allowed to download, copy, and share this book.  Reading assignments below relate to this book.

<h5>Weekly Topics:</h5>
<ol>
The course will roughly follow this schedule of weekly topics, although I may modify the schedule depending on our progress throughout the semester.  Readings and topics refer to the Erickson book.
<h5>Weekly Topics:</h5>
<ol>
<li> [ 9/1,  9/3] Chapter 0 <a href="http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/00-intro.pdf">Introduction and algorithmic thinking</a>
<li> [ 9/8, 9/10] Chapter 1 -- Recursion
<li> [9/15, 9/17] Chapter 3 -- Dynamic Programming
<li> [9/22, 9/24] Chapter 4 -- Greedy Algorithms
<li> [9/29, 10/1] Chapter 5 -- Graph Algorihtms
<li> [10/6, 10/08] Chapter 6 -- Depth First Search

<h5>University policy on observance of religious holidays</h5>

In accordance with University policy, students should notify faculty during the first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. For details and policy, see: students.gwu.edu/accommodations-religious-holidays.

<h5>Academic integrity code</h5>

Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. For details and complete code, see: studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity

<h5>Use of Electronic Course Materials and Class Recordings</h5>
Students are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including
recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with
their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and
recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course
related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the
instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course
materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of
Conduct. Please contact the instructor if you have questions regarding
what constitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course
materials and/or recorded class sessions. Please contact Disability
Support Services if you have questions or need assistance in accessing
electronic course materials.
  
  <h5>Support for students outside the classroom</h5>

<i>Disability Support Services (DSS)</i>:
Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Disability Support Services office at 202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. For additional information see: disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/

<i>Mental Health Services 202-994-5300</i>:
The University's Mental Health Services offers 24/7 assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills problems. Services for students include: crisis and emergency mental health consultations confidential assessment, counseling services (individual and small group), and referrals. For additional information see: counselingcenter.gwu.edu/
