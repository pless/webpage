<h3>CSCI 3212</h3>

<h4>Course Description:</h4>
Core concepts in design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. Hashing, heaps, trees. Graph algorithms, searching, sorting, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, backtracking. Combinatorial optimization techniques. NP-completeness. 

<h5>Prerequisite:</h5> CSCI 1311, CSCI 2113.

<h5>Learning outcomes:</h5> At the end of this course, student should understand and be able to define paradigms for solving algorithmic problems, including dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer.<br>
Given an unfamiliar problem, then should be able to formulate that problem in mathematical terms and to understand which algorithmic paradigms are appropriate to solve the problem.<br>

Students should be able to implement an algorithmic approach to a problem, understand the trade-offs that come from choosing different data structures, and be able to formally prove the correctness of their algorithm and to formally evaluate its running time.<br>

<h5>Minimum course load:</h5> In a 15-week semester, including exam
week, students are expected to spend a minimum of 100 minutes of
out-of-class work for every 50 minutes of direct instruction, for a
minimum total of 2.5 hours a week. A 3-credit course includes 2.5
hours of direct instruction and a minimum of 5 hours of independent
learning, or a minimum of 7.5 hours per week. More information about
GWâ€™s credit hour policy can be found at:

<h5>Textbook:</h5> Because of the incredible amount of information available online, and that I will post detailed lecture notes and pointers to other reading/materials, there is no assigned textbook.  However, students that wish to supplement these materials can explore these textbooks.  Because we are not assigning problems from these textbooks, and because the material in this class is consistent over time, all editions of these textbooks are equally good.
<ol>
<li>Algorithms. By S.Dasgupta, C.Papadimitriou and U.Vazirani (McGraw-Hill). This is an elegant, small-ish textbook with just the right material for a first course in algorithms. Explanations of algorithmic ideas use excellent examples and proofs are easy to follow. It is not, however, as comprehensive as the one below.
<li>Introduction to Algorithms. T.H.Cormen, C.E.Leiserson and R.L.Rivest. (McGraw-Hill). This book covers much more material than can be handled in a single-semester course. It's advantages are that it makes a useful desktop reference, algorithms are fleshed out in detail with examples and accurate pseudocode, and the book is up-to-date in most areas. Disadvantages: it's bulky, and can initially be intimidating.
<li>Foundations of Algorithms. R.Neapolitan and K.Naimpour (Jones and Bartlett). This book is a compromise between the sweeping coverage of the Cormen book and the tight, condensed Dasgupta book. The book covers some topics, such as backtracking and branch-and-bound, that are hard to find in other books. Overall, a nice book with solid coverage of topics that are well-presented.
<li>The following online lecture notes are also fantastic:

<h5>University policy on observance of religious holidays</h5>

In accordance with University policy, students should notify faculty during the first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. For details and policy, see: students.gwu.edu/accommodations-religious-holidays.

<h5>Academic integrity code</h5>

Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. For details and complete code, see: studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity

<h5>Support for students outside the classroom</h5>

<i>Disability Support Services (DSS)</i>:
Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Disability Support Services office at 202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. For additional information see: disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/

<i>Mental Health Services 202-994-5300</i>:
The University's Mental Health Services offers 24/7 assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and study skills problems. Services for students include: crisis and emergency mental health consultations confidential assessment, counseling services (individual and small group), and referrals. For additional information see: counselingcenter.gwu.edu/
