My group is part of the Media and Machines Laboratory, which I share
with Tao Ju, Caitlin Kelleher, Dennis Cosgrove and
Yasu Furukawa.  We are always looking for outstanding students at all
levels, including students with backgrounds outside of computer
science.

Current undergraduate students looking for research opportunities, or
current MS students looking for project or thesis ideas should
e-mail or drop by my office to discuss current opportunities.  Most
likely I will ask you to demo or explain some previous projects that
you've done.  If you haven't had the chance to work on many projects
in the past, <a href="http://research.engineering.wustl.edu/~pless/canIDoResearch.html">click here</a>.<br> 

<p>Students seeking admission to the PhD program should
<a href="http://cse.wustl.edu/graduateprograms/Pages/default.aspx">apply
directly</a> to our graduate program.  If you mention my name anywhere
in your application, it will be forwarded to me.
