<h3>CSCI 3907/6907 Computational Photography</h3>

<h5>Course Description:</h5>

This course explores core concepts in design and analysis of systems
that co-design the physical process of capturing an image with
computational processing required to optimize or reconstruct that
image.  This merges research and ideas from the areas of computer
graphics, computer vision, optics, and imaging, and offers ways to
overcome the limitations of traditional cameras.

Weekly topics, readings and assignments will be available on the
<a href="http://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~pless/ComputationalPhotography">course webpage</a>.

<h5>Textbook:</h5>
Readings will be drawn from a variety of sources and
<a href="https://szeliski.org/Book/">This amazing online, free textbook</a>.

<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
This course expect strong programming skills and a course in algorithms (equivalent to either CSCI 3212 or 6212).

<h5>Learning outcomes:</h5>
At the end of this course, students should be able to (1) describe the
main components of the digital image capture pipeline, including the
key differences between different types of digital image sensors (2)
develop proficiency in various image processing techniques, including
filtering, frequency domain analysis and transformations, image
pyramids, etc., (3) write programs in Matlab or python or similar to
implement algorithms for texture synthesis and hole filling;
intelligent scissors; compositing, blending, matting and mosaicing;
warping and morphing, and (4) use basic computer vision techniques to
synthesize images, including image alignment; multi-perspective
panoramas; image-based re-lighting and rendering, etc.

<h5>Use of Electronic Course Materials and Class Recordings</h5>
Students are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including
recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with
their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and
recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course
related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the
instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course
materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of
Conduct. Please contact the instructor if you have questions regarding
what constitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course
materials and/or recorded class sessions. Please contact Disability
Support Services if you have questions or need assistance in accessing
electronic course materials.

<h5>University policy on observance of religious holidays</h5>

In accordance with University policy, students should notify faculty during the first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. For details and policy, see: students.gwu.edu/accommodations-religious-holidays.

<h5>Academic integrity code</h5>

Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. For details and complete code, see: studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity

<h5>Minimum course load:</h5> In a 15-week semester, including exam
week, students are expected to spend a minimum of 100 minutes of
out-of-class work for every 50 minutes of direct instruction, for a
minimum total of 2.5 hours a week. A 3-credit course includes 2.5
hours of direct instruction and a minimum of 5 hours of independent
learning, or a minimum of 7.5 hours per week. More information about
GWâ€™s credit hour policy can be found at:
<a href="provost.gwu.edu/policies-forms">provost.gwu.edu/policies-forms</a>

<h5>Support for students outside the classroom</h5>

<i>Disability Support Services (DSS)</i>:
Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Disability Support Services office at 202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations. For additional information see: disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/

<i>Mental Health Services 202-994-5300</i>:
