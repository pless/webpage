<h3>CSCI 3907/6907, Computational Photography, Spring 2022</h3>

This course meets once per week, Monday, 12:00 -- 2:30 pm.  Our first week we will be following University policies to meet online.  Information about course policies is available in the <a href="syllabus.html">course syllabus</a>, and this page will be updated to reflect the lecture topics, assignments and readings.

<h3>Assignments and Projects and Expectations</h3>

This is an advanced undergraduate/graduate course, so I expect you to
be able to program.  Assignments and projects will be defined in terms
of reports and data inputs and outputs, you are welcome to program in
any language you'd like --- python, java, C++, whatever.  I may
sometimes do in-class demos in matlab, because it is what I know best,
and because I think it makes the mathematical operations happening
more clear.

<h4>Project 1 is due 10am, Monday January 23.
