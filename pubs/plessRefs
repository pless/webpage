abstract ={Immune-mediated pulmonary diseases are a significant public health concern. Analysis of leukocyte behavior in the lung is essential for understanding cellular mechanisms that contribute to normal and diseased states. Here, we used two-photon imaging to study neutrophil extravasation from pulmonary vessels and subsequent interstitial migration. We found that the lungs contained a significant pool of tissue-resident neutrophils in the steady state. In response to inflammation produced by bacterial challenge or transplant-mediated, ischemia-reperfusion injury, neutrophils were rapidly recruited from the circulation and patrolled the interstitium and airspaces of the lung. Motile neutrophils often aggregated in dynamic clusters that formed and dispersed over tens of minutes. These clusters were associated with CD115+ F4/80+ Ly6C+ cells that had recently entered the lung. The depletion of blood monocytes with clodronate liposomes reduced neutrophil clustering in the lung, but acted by inhibiting neutrophil transendothelial migration upstream of interstitial migration. Our results suggest that a subset of monocytes serve as key regulators of neutrophil extravasation in the lung and may be an attractive target for the treatment of inflammatory pulmonary diseases.},

The system comprises two parts: The first uses digital imaging of a known grid pattern through the windshield of interest to create a distortion map of that windshield; the second uses the distortion maps created for 100 windshields (some acceptable and some not) and automatically learns a decision-tree-based classifier. We show results that highlight the robustness of this system, including a demonstration that the distortion map for a windshield is consistently measured over 3 years, and cross-validation study shows that we can effectively classify windshields based on the distortion maps.},

The value of 2P microscopy is that it affords an unparalleled view of single-cell spatiotemporal dynamics deep within intact tissues and organs. As the technology develops and new transgenic mice and fluorescent probes become available, 2P microscopy will serve as an increasingly valuable tool for assessing cell function and probing molecular mechanisms. Here we discuss the technical aspects related to 2P microscope design, explain in detail various tissue imaging preparations, and walk the reader through the often daunting process of analyzing multidimensional data sets and presenting the experimental results.},

  abstract={ Events in surveillance video occur over many time scales,
                  but common approaches to background subtraction and
                  video representation are implicitly based on a
                  single temporal scale. In this work, we derive a set
                  of causal filters which define a temporal
                  scale-space representation for the activity at each
                  pixel. This scale-space can be maintained and
                  continuously updated in real time and, for static
                  cameras viewing dynamic scenes, has several
                  interesting properties. In particular, it directly
                  characterizes interesting temporal features and
                  supports approximate reconstruction of the video
                  history under challenging noise conditions. The
                  temporal scale-space grounds novel approaches to
                  several applications, including a natural
                  visualization tool to summarize recent video
                  behavior in a single image, and a tool to directly
                  report how long the object has been present in a

abstract="Compressive-sensing cameras are an important new class of sensors that have different design constraints than standard cameras. Surprisingly, little work has explored the relationship between compressive-sensing measurements and differential image motion. We show that, given modest constraints on the measurements and image motions, we can omit the computationally expensive compressive-sensing reconstruction step and obtain more accurate motion estimates with significantly less computation time. We also formulate a compressive-sensing reconstruction problem that incorporates known image motion and show that this method outperforms the state-of-the-art in compressive-sensing video reconstruction.
